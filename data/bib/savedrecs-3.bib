Abstract = {With the new round of industrial and technological revolution in China,
   the new normal of the Chinese economy is increasingly in the form of a
   digital economy characterized by continued growth and development
   potential. The digital economy has become an important engine driving
   the growth of the Chinese economy. The digital transformation of
   enterprises is a hot topic and poses a difficult research problem. More
   importantly, ensuring the security of digitalization has become a common
   challenge faced by society. This paper analyzes the value composition of
   the digital innovation ecosystem and uses differential game theory to
   explore the optimal decision-making of leading enterprises and following
   enterprises in terms of digital innovation and social responsibility
   under different circumstances. The results show that in the digital
   innovation ecosystem, (1) leading enterprises and following enterprises
   have the least income, the weakest degree of digital innovation, and the
   weakest ability to maintain social network security under
   non-cooperative conditions; (2) overall income will increase over time,
   and digital innovation and the maintenance of social network security
   have a positive effect on the development of the digital economy; (3)
   the government encourages enterprises to develop digital innovation and
   maintain social network security and provides appropriate subsidies to
   some extent, which boosts the development of enterprises.},

Title = {Can digital transformation policy drive digital innovation of Chinese
   enterprises: based on the quasi-natural experiment of big data
   comprehensive pilot zones},
Journal = {CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 SEP 19},
Abstract = {PurposeUnder the rapid development of the digital economy, digital
   transformation has become a national-level economic development
   strategy. The digital economy's immense potential to enable enterprise
   innovation has attracted attention from government authorities. As a
   typical representative of digital innovation, China possesses
   significant advantages in the digital field, including a vast market
   size, diverse and complex consumer demands, abundant digital application
   scenarios, and massive data resources. These interrelated factors
   collectively contribute to a highly conducive ecosystem for digital
   innovation, enabling rapid technological development and large-scale
   deployment of digital transformation. The digital transformation policy
   implemented by the Chinese government provides an empirical environment
   for this study. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the
   impact and mechanism of digital transformation policy implemented by the
   Chinese government on enterprises' digital
   innovation.Design/methodology/approachThis study regards the ``big data
   comprehensive pilot zone{''} policy as a quasi-natural experiment. The
   research sample consists of panel data from Chinese listed companies
   from 2010 to 2022. The difference-in-differences identification strategy
   is used to test the impact of digital transformation policy on
   enterprise digital innovation.FindingsThis study reveals that China's
   big data comprehensive pilot zone policy has promoted the increase of
   enterprise digital patents, reflecting the incentive effect of China's
   digital transformation policy on enterprise digital innovation.
   Mechanism analysis shows that the digital transformation policy
   effectively promotes enterprise digital innovation by optimizing
   industrial structure, increasing research and development support and
   improving the financial environment. Heterogeneity analysis indicates
   that digital transformation policy has a better positive effect on
   digital innovation for enterprises in the eastern region, non-resource
   cities and technology-intensive industries.Originality/valueAn essential
   distinction of this study from prior research lies in its emphasis on
   innovation with digital characteristics. By locking in the digital
   innovation patent of enterprises, the effectiveness of digital
   transformation policy can be more accurately evaluated, and the
   understanding of the impact of digital transformation policy on the
   digitalization of micro-entities of enterprises can be deepened.
   Furthermore, this study also provides empirical evidence from China's
   digital regulatory framework, enriching the relevant research in this
   field.},

Abstract = {Developing the right structure of interdependence is crucial to
   determining orchestrators' success in digitally transforming ecosystems
   and deepening value creation. Although firms' digitally transforming
   ecosystems represent a recent yet fast-growing phenomenon, the current
   literature offers limited theoretical insights and empirical guidance on
   the dynamic role of orchestrators in digital transformation (DT). Hence,
   through a multiple case study of seven orchestrator firms and their
   digital ecosystems, this study introduced a framework explaining how
   firms digitally transform ecosystems and their structure of
   interdependence through multifaceted, multilevel three stages: Digital
   intermediation, digital envelopment, and smartification. These stages
   offer an alternative perspective in relation to current scholarship,
   which suggests that firms should pursue reducing external dependence.
   Building on these findings, we propose a new theoretical framework:
   Orchestration work in the DT of ecosystems. Implications and
   opportunities for further research are also discussed.},

Title = {Shaping the future: ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of
   digital innovation ecosystems (DIEs) amid the Twin Transition},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to investigate the ethical, legal and social
   implications (ELSI) of digital transformation within digital innovation
   ecosystems (DIEs), particularly in the context of the Twin Transition,
   which integrates digital and green transformation. It seeks to highlight
   the agency and heterogeneity of actors within DIEs, emphasizing their
   active role in implementing strategies that align innovation with
   sustainability. By moving beyond a technology-centered perspective, the
   study contributes to the discourse on how DIE stakeholders navigate the
   intersection of digitalization and sustainability through collaborative
   innovation.Design/methodology/approachUsing a three-phase qualitative
   research approach, this study first conducts a thematic analysis of
   academic literature on ELSI within DIEs, conceptualizing them as
   multi-actor ecosystems. It then applies a strengths, weaknesses,
   opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis to identify the internal
   challenges and external pressures faced by the diverse participants in
   DIEs. Finally, it employs the TOWS framework to develop strategic,
   actor-specific recommendations for navigating the Twin
   Transition.FindingsThe research underscores that addressing ELSI is
   fundamental to achieving a responsible digital transformation that
   aligns with sustainable development. It highlights that the success of
   DIEs is not driven by centralized decision-making but by the collective
   actions and strategic choices of diverse stakeholders. By leveraging
   ecosystem-wide strengths and opportunities while mitigating weaknesses
   and threats, DIE participants can foster inclusive, ethical and socially
   responsible value creation.Practical implicationsThe findings provide
   actionable insights for participants within DIEs, demonstrating how
   ELSI-informed strategies can guide digital transformation while ensuring
   technological progress remains equitable and responsible. It provides a
   structured methodology for ecosystem actors to assess risks, identify
   ethical challenges and develop governance mechanisms that support
   sustainable innovation.Social implicationsBy addressing the broader
   societal consequences of digital transformation, this research
   highlights the governance-related dimension of ELSI, stressing the need
   for a clear vision of the type of society that digital transformation
   seeks to build. It reinforces that DIEs must engage in active, inclusive
   decision-making to ensure that digital innovation contributes to equity,
   safety and long-term social welfare, ultimately shaping a responsible
   and sustainable digital future.Originality/valueThis study advances a
   human-centered, actor-driven approach to DIEs, moving beyond the
   implicit assumption of DIEs as self-governing entities. By embedding
   ELSI into strategic frameworks like SWOT and TOWS, the study advocates
   for a holistic approach that transcends mere technological adoption,
   respectively, a politically engaged and ethically grounded perspective
   on digital transformation. It argues that strategic planning must
   actively involve stakeholders in defining a sustainable, inclusive and
   ethically responsible digital future.},

Abstract = {Digital innovations are revolutionizing the way businesses and
   industries operate. Yet, the functioning of teams dealing with digital
   innovations remains elusive. This study offers new theoretical and
   empirical insights about how innovation teams function within the
   context of digital transformation through a better understanding of the
   team process-cognition nexus. In this study, a qualitative, in-depth
   investigation is carried out with three innovation teams, embedded in
   three telecommunications organizations. The innovation teams that are
   studied deal with the development of solutions based on digital
   technological innovations. The findings illustrate that digital
   innovation teams depend on two cognitive states to function:
   team-specific cognitions required for digital innovation and digital
   project-specific cognitions. Each cognitive state is shaped and
   transformed by distinct interactions between team cognition, teamwork,
   and taskwork throughout the digital innovation process. This study
   depicts a dynamic model that illustrates the functioning of innovation
   teams across the different stages leading to digital innovation
   materialization. Opportunities for further research are offered.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to understand if and how European digital
   innovation hubs (DIHs) filling the role of knowledge brokers (KBs) can
   support the digital transformation (DX) of small and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs) by triggering open innovation (OI) practices.
   Design/methodology/approach After presenting a conceptual model of
   reference, a survey and a subsequent in-depth interview were conducted
   to capture evidence from Italian DIHs. These structures were selected
   for their growing importance, as confirmed by the National Plan for
   Industry 4.0. Findings The findings highlight that Italian DIHs act not
   only as KBs but also as knowledge sources that give rise to a digital
   imprinting process that is able to shape the DX of SMEs.
   Originality/value Research on knowledge sharing and OI has mainly
   focused on large firms. The study covers the gaps identified in the
   literature by considering the role of KBs in enabling SMEs to embrace
   DX.},

Title = {A conceptual framework for asymmetric collaborations between startups
   and big corporations in digital innovation ecosystems},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 21},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper explores the dynamics of asymmetric collaborations
   between startups and large corporations within digital innovation
   ecosystems (DIEs). The study identifies key themes, challenges and
   strategic mechanisms necessary for successful
   collaborations.Design/methodology/approachA systematic literature review
   was conducted, analyzing 440 articles retrieved from Scopus and Web of
   Science. Latent Dirichlet allocation text-mining identified four key
   research topics, further examined through the 6W framework to capture
   multi-dimensional insights.FindingsThe review identifies four thematic
   clusters: (1) startups' market entry strategies, often reliant on
   corporates for legitimacy and scalability, (2) innovation transfer and
   strategic partnerships, enabled by intermediaries and open innovation
   programs, (3) investment and success dynamics, where corporate venture
   capital accelerates growth but risks dependency and (4) managing
   collaborative development, requiring cultural alignment and
   organizational flexibility. Applying the 6W framework highlights how
   asymmetries manifest across dimensions: Who (startups, corporates,
   intermediaries, universities), What (strategic alignment, knowledge
   transfer and venturing), Why (innovation, agility and legitimacy), How
   (orchestration, cultural fit and digital tools), Where (hybrid
   physical-digital arenas) and When (timing of entry, adaptation and
   investment). These insights reveal that collaboration outcomes depend on
   governing asymmetries through strategic, organizational and policy
   mechanisms.Originality/valueThis paper provides a conceptual framework
   synthesizing key constructs such as actors, context, mechanisms and
   motivations in startup-corporate collaborations. The study is among the
   first to systematically link the dynamics of asymmetrical collaborations
   to the broader themes of DIEs. Its insights contribute to both academic
   research and policymaking by highlighting mechanisms to balance
   asymmetries and enhance innovation scalability.},

Journal = {TECHNOVATION},

Abstract = {This study explores how knowledge ecosystems (KEs) led by a knowledge
   broker (KB) can support the digital transformation of Micro-, Small and
   Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs). By employing an exploratory research
   design and action research methodology, the paper proposes and applies
   an analytical framework to investigate the characteristics of KEs and
   the knowledge managed by the KB as the innovation intermediary acting as
   leader of the KE The case study selected uncovers the dimensions of a
   regional KE guided by a digital innovation hub (DIH) supporting MSMEs
   towards the adoption of the ``Digital Artisan platform{''} deriving from
   an Industry 4.0 project. The findings highlight the importance of trust,
   strategic alignment, and dynamic capabilities of KBs in enhancing MSMEs'
   digital journey and emphasize the location dimension of the regional KE
   as a means for providing tailored support. This research contributes to
   the theoretical and practical understanding of regional KEs enabling the
   digital transformation through KBs who are the innovation intermediaries
   covering the role of leaders of the ecosystem.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report on a qualitative exploratory case study of a
   national-level government-led digital transformation. We depart from
   most studies on government digital transformation that largely focus on
   improving existing services, bureaucratic processes, or adopting
   emerging digital technologies. Instead, we analyze the process of a
   government-led digital transformation aimed at addressing significant
   institutional voids within a resource-constrained context. Drawing from
   60 interviews with stakeholders in the Ghanaian FinTech ecosystem, we
   theorize the concept of digital branching strategy as an alternative
   lens to envisage government-led digital transformation that considers
   the resource-constrained context and characteristics of governments. Our
   findings show that governments, especially those in resource-constrained
   contexts pursue digital transformation through exploring frugal
   innovations and leveraging established resources, structures, and
   relationships within an ecosystem. We subsequently develop a process
   model to explain the mechanisms of a national-level government-led
   digital transformation. Based on the findings and the model, our study
   offers critical insights to re-imagine government-led digital
   transformation in resource-constrained contexts by demonstrating how
   pursuing a digital branching strategy leads to planned and emergent
   outcomes because of the generative nature of the transformation.},

   digital innovation performance -Empirical data from China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Business ecosystems serve as a critical platform for firms to accumulate
   innovation resources, co-create value with stakeholders, and achieve
   innovation outcomes. Strengthening ecosystem governance can mitigate
   issues like ``free-riding{''} and optimize the overall functioning of
   the ecosystem. Enhancing digital innovation performance through
   effective ecosystem governance has become a key strategy for
   complementary firms seeking innovation and growth. This study
   investigates how complementary firms within business ecosystems adapt to
   governance mechanisms to boost digital innovation performance. A survey
   of 684 complementary firms within the business ecosystem was conducted,
   with multiple regression analysis applied to examine the impact of
   ecosystem governance on digital innovation performance from the
   complementary firms' perspective. The analysis also explores the
   mediating role of digital capabilities and the moderating effect of
   technological dynamism. The findings indicate that: (1) both contractual
   and relational governance positively and significantly influence digital
   innovation performance; (2) digital perceptual capabilities and digital
   resource coordination capabilities mediate the relationship between
   ecosystem governance and digital innovation performance of complementary
   firms; (3) technological dynamism negatively moderates the relationship
   between contractual governance and digital capabilities, but does not
   influence the relationship between relational governance and digital
   capabilities. This research advances the understanding of the
   relationship between ecosystem governance and digital innovation
   performance in the context of the digital economy, offering insights
   from the perspective of complementary firms and highlighting the complex
   mechanisms through which ecosystem governance affects their digital
   innovation outcomes. The conclusions provide practical implications for
   complementary firms aiming to enhance their digital innovation
   performance within the digital economy.},

Title = {Intelligent development of high-end equipment sub-industries: digital
   innovation ecosystem analysis},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT DECISION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 11},
Abstract = {PurposeWith ongoing technological advancements and profound shifts in
   industrial dynamics, the digital innovation ecosystem offers significant
   opportunities for transforming and developing the high-end equipment
   manufacturing industry (HEMI). However, there is limited research on how
   the digital innovation ecosystem influences intelligent development in
   HEMI, especially concerning the in-depth examination of key
   characteristics in each sub-industry. This paper examines HEMI
   sub-industries to explore the relationship between the digital
   innovation ecosystem and intelligent development. It also identifies how
   different sub-industries emphasize various ecosystem characteristic
   elements. The ultimate goal is to provide specific theoretical support
   and practical policy guidance for achieving intelligent development in
   each sub-industry.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs a
   multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to analyze feature importance and
   evaluate the digital innovation ecosystem's impact on intelligent
   development across HEMI sub-industries. By analyzing data from 181
   enterprises across five sub-industries - aerospace equipment, ocean
   engineering equipment, satellite manufacturing and applications, rail
   transit equipment and intelligent manufacturing equipment - it
   identifies and ranks the contributions of ecosystem elements to
   intelligent development. The findings uncover critical trends and focal
   points within the ecosystem, providing nuanced and targeted guidance for
   practical implementation in each sub-industry.FindingsThe research
   findings indicate that the digital innovation ecosystem positively
   drives intelligent development across various sub-industries. However,
   differences exist in the impact of the digital innovation ecosystem on
   the intelligent development of different sub-industries. Notably, due to
   the distinct developmental characteristics inherent to each
   sub-industry, they place different emphases on selecting elements in the
   digital innovation ecosystem. These observations contribute to the
   formulation of differentiated development strategies and provide
   practical development pathways for a comprehensive understanding of the
   influencing mechanisms in each industry.Originality/valueThis paper
   elucidates the specific impacts of the digital innovation ecosystem on
   the intelligent development of HEMI sub-industries. Empirical research
   analyzes the selection emphasis on characteristic elements within the
   digital innovation ecosystem for each sub-industry, addressing gaps in
   detailed studies. By employing an MLP model and feature heatmaps through
   deep learning methods, this study offers a novel theoretical perspective
   on the intelligent development of enterprises across sub-industries.},

Abstract = {The remarkable connectivity and embeddedness of digital technologies
   enable innovations undertaken by a broad set of actors, often beyond
   organizational and industry boundaries, whose relationships mimic those
   of interdependent species in a natural ecosystem. These digital
   innovation ecosystems, if successful, can spawn countless innovations of
   substantial social and economic value, but are complex and prone to
   often surprising failure. Aiming to understand ecosystems as a new
   organizational form for digital innovations, I develop a theory that
   addresses an underexplored but important question: In a digital
   innovation ecosystem, how are the efforts of autonomous parties
   integrated into a coherent whole and what role do digital technologies
   play in this integration? By synthesizing ecological and information
   perspectives, this information ecology theory identifies several key
   functions that digital technologies serve in providing the information
   needed to support the interactions and tasks for innovation in
   ecosystems of varying scales. This theory contributes to digital
   innovation research new insights on managing part-whole relations, the
   role of digital technologies in innovation, and multilevel interactions
   in and across digital innovation ecosystems. The theory can also inspire
   the development of next-generation information systems for ecosystems as
   a new organizational form.},

Abstract = {Digital transformation is continuously changing ecosystems, which also
   forces established companies to re-evaluate their value proposition.
   However, only transformations of single ecosystems have been studied.
   Therefore, this work targets to examine the similarities of digital
   transformation in five platform ecosystems: automotive, blockchain,
   financial, insurance, and IIoT. For our analysis, we combine the
   strengths of conceptual modeling using e3 value with a cluster analysis
   based on text mining to identify similarities in the respective
   ecosystems. As a result, we identified 15 clusters. Cluster 01 is the
   core cluster, containing the roles of organizations from all five
   ecosystems. Cluster 02-05 are intertwined, as they include roles from at
   least two ecosystems. Clusters 06-15 are ecosystem-specific that only
   include roles found in one ecosystem. Scholars and practitioners can use
   these clusters when analyzing or building a new platform ecosystem, or
   transforming a traditional ecosystem towards a platform ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Innovation is a way to increase the competitive position on the market.
   Many companies are looking for their advantage in digital
   transformation. In the past few years, we have seen digitization bring
   its first benefits. Advances in automation, big data and analytics, and
   the Internet of Things create additional opportunities. We can also
   observe that not all digital transformation projects are delivering the
   expected results. The research objective of this article is to indicate
   the possibility of using Social network analysis (SNA) and
   Organizational network analysis (ONA) to identify the innovation
   potential in digital transformation projects and to indicate potential
   problems. Two cases ofprojects (A and B) were selected. Their basic
   assumptions and characteristics were similar. Graph -based analysis of
   networks in projects A and B indicates the existence of a difference in
   terms of cooperation network and knowledge flow network, which could
   have an impact on the results of the projects.},

Title = {Enhancing digital transformation in SMEs: The dynamic capabilities of
   innovation intermediaries within ecosystems},
Journal = {LONG RANGE PLANNING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {While the dynamic capabilities framework discusses the sensing, seizing,
   and transformation capabilities of organisations, we lack knowledge of
   the specific dynamic capabilities of intermediaries that support
   collaborations leading to the digital transformation of small and medium
   enterprises (SMEs). The specific role of intermediaries supporting
   collaboration between SMEs and the ecosystem, the unique barriers
   confronted by SMEs, and the long-term focus required for digital
   transformation suggest that intermediaries should deploy specific
   dynamic capabilities. By conducting in-depth interviews with innovation
   intermediaries, SMEs, and other ecosystem actors in the Ostrobothnia
   region of Finland, we make three original contributions to the dynamic
   capability framework. First, while the literature has discussed spotting
   opportunities and bringing partners together as sensing dynamic
   capability, we make an original contribution by demonstrating the
   `ancillary opportunity spotting capability' of intermediaries. This
   includes intermediaries spotting opportunities to develop digital
   technologies to address business, environmental, or social challenges of
   ecosystem actors (e.g. developing carbon-neutral solutions) where SME
   digital transformation is only indirectly achieved: hence, this is
   described as an ancillary opportunity. Second, while the literature has
   discussed that the seizing capability involves exploiting opportunities
   by using resources, we identified that intermediaries leverage `business
   model co-creation capability' for seizing. This predominantly consists
   of them co-creating - with the stakeholders of SMEs (i.e. customers,
   suppliers, and competitors) - the business models of SMEs for digital
   transformation. Third, as a transformation capability, intermediaries
   leverage `ecosystem revamping capability' for continued and scaled-up
   SME digital transformation, the capabilities associated with which
   include altering opportunity and ecosystem structures, bridging
   inter-ecosystem collaborations, and deploying international best

Abstract = {PurposeIn the era of digital transformation, digital innovation has
   emerged as a crucial driver of competitiveness and growth. However,
   limited knowledge exists on how digital innovation diffuses across
   supply chains, particularly in the manufacturer-distributor
   relationship. Drawing upon diffusion of innovation theory and social
   network theory, this study aims to examine how manufacturers' digital
   innovation impacts distributors' digital innovation, focusing on the
   moderating roles of cooperation length and network status of
   manufacturers and distributors.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses
   a sample of 233 manufacturer-distributor pairs from the Chinese
   paper-making industry. Geographically, the survey comprises sample firms
   nationwide, covering most regions and provinces in China.FindingsThe
   authors find that manufacturers' digital innovation positively affects
   distributors' digital innovation. This relationship is strengthened by
   cooperation length and manufacturers' network status but dampened by
   distributors' network status. The findings provide insights into how
   digital innovation diffuses across supply chain partners and highlight
   the importance of social relationships and network positions in this
   digital innovation diffusion process.Originality/valueThis study makes a
   significant contribution to the field of supply chain management by
   offering deep insights into the diffusion of digital innovation across
   supply chain partners. It highlights the significance of social
   relationships and network positions in the process of digital innovation
   diffusion, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between
   manufacturers and distributors in the context of digital transformation.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurial firms are central actors in the process of the
   generation and diffusion of digital innovation which, on the other hand,
   provides a wide range of opportunities for entrepreneurs. Although
   existing research has produced several contributions on both topics, the
   knowledge generated in the field appears fragmented and the findings are
   sometimes ambiguous. The reason for this fragmentation can be traced
   back to the lack of reference frameworks that clarify the most used
   concepts, thus providing a shared language. This study aims to
   consolidate the state-of-art of scholarly research published over the
   past 20 years at the intersection of the innovation and entrepreneurship
   fields of study. To this aim, we carried out a systematic literature
   review by analyzing a set of 185 papers in order to find what are the
   relevant topics in the investigated research domain. This activity was
   performed using MySLR software. Besides a descriptive picture of the
   scientific activity, a map of the literature published to date that
   simultaneously addresses the two themes, is provided. In particular, we
   characterized the six relevant topics in the investigated research
   domain: start-ups' collaboration networks, business-model innovation,
   digital platforms, digital ventures, the digital entrepreneur's profile,
   and digital-innovation ecosystems. Based on these results the article
   proposes three main research directions for future research: multi-level
   analysis of Digital Innovation in Entrepreneurial Ventures;
   interdisciplinary approaches; development of specific theories for
   igital Innovation. Overall, the value of research is to provide a
   framework for analyzing the phenomenon of innovation in and with
   entrepreneurial firms that can be used as a reference model for both
   entrepreneurship and innovation management researchers.},

Abstract = {The digital evolution that businesses are facing highlights the need for
   organisations to be agile, to collaborate with customers and to change
   the mindset of employees and managers to achieve effective digital
   transformation. This study explores the role of regenerative unlearning,
   defined as a dynamic capability that enables organisations to adapt by
   systematically renewing knowledge structures, in customer collaboration,
   organisational agility and digital transformation. Using PLS-SEM, a
   sample of medium-sized Spanish manufacturing companies was analysed. The
   results show that regenerative unlearning improves customer
   collaboration, organisational agility, and digital transformation.
   Findings also show the influence of customer collaboration on
   organisational agility and of organisational agility on digital
   transformation. This research contributes to the literature by providing
   a better understanding of the importance of regenerative unlearning,
   collaboration with customers and agility in the digital context of the
   Spanish manufacturing industry.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study investigates the role of interlocking director
   networks (IDN) in driving corporate digital transformation (CDT) and
   explores the moderating role of agency costs, diversification and
   financial distress.Design/methodology/approachThe analysis uses data
   from Chinese A-share listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
   exchanges from 2006 to 2021. A two-way fixed-effects model is employed
   to assess the impact of IDNs on CDT.FindingsThe results indicate that
   IDNs positively affect CDT. Furthermore, this effect is enhanced by
   agency costs and financial distress, while diversification acts as a
   negative moderator.Originality/valueInformal institutions such as IDNs
   play a significant role in corporate governance in China's relational
   society. This study focuses on the influence of informal institutions on
   digital transformation, expanding the understanding of the economic
   consequences of IDNs and enriching the literature on factors influencing
   digital transformation.},

Abstract = {Enterprise data resource sharing is an effective means to promote
   enterprise collaboration, help the government make scientific and
   effective decisions, and facilitate the development of the digital
   innovation ecosystem. In order to accurately analyze the enterprise data
   resource sharing strategies of digital platform enterprises, cooperative
   enterprises, and the government and the impact of government incentives
   on sharing, taking the digital innovation ecosystem as the background,
   three decision-making models of Nash non-cooperation, Stackelberg, and
   collaborative cooperation are constructed by using the differential game
   method. Their equilibrium results are obtained, analyzed comparatively,
   and simulated numerically. The conclusions are as follows: 1) Under the
   three strategy options, the data resource sharing effort level is
   positively correlated with the data resource sharing capability
   coefficient, the influence coefficient of effort level on the digital
   innovation ecosystem, the digital technology level coefficient of
   digital platform enterprises, and negatively correlated with the cost
   coefficient of data resource sharing and the elimination rate of shared
   data resources. 2) Government incentives for data resource sharing can
   raise the data resource sharing effort level by digital platform
   enterprises and cooperative enterprises and enhance the optimal benefits
   for all three parties and the system. 3) In the collaborative game, the
   optimal benefits of the three parties and the system are maximized, and
   a reasonable benefit distribution coefficient is determined to achieve
   Pareto optimality. Finally, some suggestions and strategies are provided
   to promote enterprise data resource sharing and government incentives.},

Abstract = {Digital transformation (DT) is reshaping construction, yet firms
   struggle to implement it. Drawing on the resource-based view and upper
   echelons theory, we employ machine learning techniques to analyse an
   panel dataset comprising 861 annual observations from Chinese listed
   construction firms over a 12 year period from 2011 to 2022. We identify
   and rank DT drivers: a digital-innovation mindset among top managers
   dominates, followed by inter-organizational collaboration and boundary
   spanning; technology inputs and environmental support are secondary. We
   prioritize leadership and partnerships as levers for effective DT and
   offer practical guidance for governance and operations, aligned with UN
   Sustainable Development Goals.},

   opportunity-centric perspective on digital innovation and transformation},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {As proliferating digital literature ignores how digital opportunities
   are generated in the first place, digital innovation and transformation
   can be ontologically ungrounded. To fill this gap, following a realist
   perspective of entrepreneurship, this article examines digital
   opportunities as profit propensities afforded by a digitalized
   environment, while treating digital innovation and transformation as the
   actualization process. To elaborate, first, we coin Digitalized
   Opportunity Space (DOS) to describe the digitalized environment as a
   critical intersection of four spaces - resource, utility, digital, and
   institutional- that muster conditions without which digital
   opportunities cannot be actualized. Second, we develop four managerial
   archetypes - resource orchestrators, utility integrators, digital
   evangelists, and institutional realists- who tend to recognize digital
   opportunities based on their organizational location and thereby endorse
   different digital innovations. Third, to facilitate a systemic and
   balanced approach to digital transformation, we recommend group-level
   heuristics - the generic density perspective, the ecosystem view of the
   firm, multi-dimensional network effects, and disciplined imagination-
   which restore totality from partiality. Taken together, the DOS
   framework (of opportunity generation), the managerial archetypes (of
   opportunity recognition), and the group-level heuristics (of opportunity
   actualization) constitute the opportunity-centric (vs technology-centric
   or organization-centric) perspective on digital innovation and
   transformation, thereby materializing the connection between digital
   literature and entrepreneurship.},

Abstract = {Digital innovation has revolutionized organizational processes and
   outcomes in several industries. Previous studies emphasize the
   transformational nature of digital innovation in redefining the nature
   of competition and exposing incumbent industry players to a dire fate.
   We focus on the retail sector, where platform sponsors leverage digital
   innovation to intermediate the exchanges between buyers and sellers and
   orchestrate complementary innovations to make the platform ecosystem
   more valuable to members. We investigate whether digital innovation in
   retail platform ecosystem renders established competencies of
   traditional intermediaries obsolete through a case study of Alibaba
   Lingshoutong, a business-to-business digital sourcing and distribution
   platform. The analysis shows the oppositional nature of digital
   innovation built from a transaction cost rationality and existing
   practices based upon social capital. This study reveals the incremental
   nature of digital innovation, a dimension which receives little
   attention thus far. Based on some preliminary empirical findings and
   conceptual rationale, we developed three propositions.},

Abstract = {In today's digital age, many managers need to find new ways to manage
   collaborations where complementary partners co-create digital solutions.
   Collaborations with partners are at the center of digital projects, but
   managing these collaborations is challenging. This article objective is
   to investigate how research and development collaborations with
   scientific and business partners contribute to digital transformation.
   This has been achieved through an empirical investigation of three
   Brazilian manufacturers that are already on their journey toward
   digitalization. The research design involves multiple case studies and
   qualitative analysis, through data collection by interviews and
   questionnaires with participants from the tactical and strategic level
   followed by content analysis as well as nonparticipant observations. The
   findings indicate that the companies are at the early stage of building
   a digital ecosystem. However, they have already secured benefits from
   pursuing open innovation practices in the form of competitive advantage
   in operational processes. The results indicate that business success
   depends more on how (disruptive) technologies are developed and used by
   engaged people to add value to the enterprise, rather than simply
   adopting new technologies by themselves. Manufacturers need to act now
   to reshape their mindset, operational processes, and business models,
   respectively, enabling the understanding that: 1) organizational
   ecosystems are becoming more open and collaborative; 2) the value of
   data capture and analysis can be developed and used for data-driven
   learning, preventive and predictive capabilities, supporting
   decision-making; 3) customers' preferences need to be internalized to
   deliver customized experiences.},

Title = {Digital innovation in the energy industry: The impact of controversies
   on the evolution of innovation ecosystems},

Abstract = {The concept of innovation ecosystems gained significant importance in
   academic research on strategy and practice over the last years. The
   emergence of the Internet of Things is disrupting industries and setting
   the ecosystem in the focus of innovation. Even traditional analog
   industries, like the energy industry, are under pressure to foster and
   manage ecosystems during their innovation efforts. Thus, the energy
   industry represents an appropriate setting for examining the evolution
   of an innovation ecosystem under the empirical lens of controversies,
   which describe the challenges of the status quo and is congruent with
   previous research on dialectical inquiries as source of innovation
   dynamics. For the purpose of this paper, the Actor-network theory (ANT)
   is regarded as an appropriate tool since it allows researchers to
   analyze how actors interact due to their specific interests with each
   other and thus configure the ecosystem in its base. ANT further enlarges
   the perspective of handling actors, while it involves not only human but
   also non-human actors (i.e. technologies). This is a valuable and
   necessary feature while dealing with digital innovations such as virtual
   power plants (VPP). By analyzing three how distinctive typologies, their
   mechanisms as well as their pathways of controversies affect the
   innovation ecosystem of VPPs and the evolution of the technological
   components of the innovation, this interaction between human and
   non-human actors is highlighted. In consequence, our research emphasizes
   the significance of involving nonhuman actors into managerial strategies
   and the role they inherit for the evolution of ecosystems. Furthermore,
   the present research reveals that controversies are not only a
   moderating factor but also a constitutional one for the coevolution of
   the ecosystem as well as the innovation itself especially during the
   forming phases. With respect to recent research of the management of
   digital innovation, this paper contributes to a better understanding of
   managerial challenges associated with digital innovation and their
   respective ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Interfaces play a key role in facilitating the integration of external
   sources of innovation and structuring ecosystems. They have been
   conceptualized as design rules that ensure the interoperability of
   independently produced modules, with important strategic value for lead
   firms to attract and control access to complementary assets in platform
   ecosystems. While meaningful, these theorizations do not fully capture
   the value and structuring role of web APIs in digital innovation
   ecosystems. We show this with an empirical study of the online travel
   ecosystem in the 26 years (1995-2021) after the first Online Travel
   Agencies (OTAs) were launched. Our findings reveal that web APIs foster
   a dynamic digital innovation ecosystem with a distributed networked
   structure in which multiple actors design and use them. We provide
   evidence of an ecosystem where decentralized interfaces enable
   decentralized governance and where interfaces establish not only
   cooperative relationships, but also competitive ones. Instead of locking
   in complementors, web APIs enable the integration of capabilities from
   multiple organizations for the co-production of services and products,
   by interfacing their information systems. Web APIs are important sources
   of value creation and capture, increasingly being used to offer or sell
   services, constituting important sources of revenue.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates the landscape of digital innovation publications
   in management and business journals. By integrating bibliometric, topic
   modeling, and qualitative analyses, we introduce a novel approach to
   synthesize the foundational, current, and future topics. Analyzing 684
   documents, we first identify three foundational topics: digital
   transformation, digital platform ecosystems, and digital innovation
   foundations. Second, we reveal ten current topics: digital business
   model innovation, digital process innovation, digital strategy, digital
   product innovation, digital capabilities, open innovation, digital
   platform ecosystems, digital transformation, digital service innovation,
   and digital innovation adoption. Third, we analyze the theoretical
   perspectives and foundations that underpin these topics through
   qualitative interpretation. The paper contributes to digital innovation
   literature by providing an overarching multi-level framework that links
   contextual conditions, mechanisms, and outcomes across individual,
   organizational, and industry levels. Furthermore, it identifies key
   underlying theories that shape the field and proposes a future research
   agenda for multidisciplinary theoretical bridging.},

Abstract = {This research extends literature on the emergence of service ecosystems
   by developing new theoretical insight and explanation into how service
   ecosystems experience change and stability over time. Empirically, our
   case study focuses on digital transformation in the New Zealand public
   sector and the enterprise services market in 2010-2017. The exploratory
   and illustrative study builds on 22 in-depth interviews and extensive
   document analysis. We reveal three key mechanisms of service ecosystem
   emergence: compression, ecotonal coupling, and refraction. These
   mechanisms contribute to overcoming conflationary theorizing and the
   value of emergence in service research by establishing emergent
   relationality and a processual intertwining of being and becoming. These
   become the basis of multi-levelled, multidimensional complexity and
   cumulative organizing. We conclude the work by discussing the paper's
   contribution to service research.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the creation of value through the interactions of
   consumer and professional stakeholders in digital innovation ecosystems.
   We examine this by applying the methodological approach of Social Media
   Analytics (SMA) which is an interdisciplinary approach that seeks to
   combine, extend and adapt methods for analysing social media data. By
   utilising the SMA framework to track user-generated contents published
   on social media platforms, we assess how consumer and professional
   stakeholders associate value to Storytel, a new entrant in the Swedish
   publishing industry that is offering digital subscription service for
   streaming audiobooks. Drawing from a dataset of 2633 user -generated
   contents, our findings illustrate the value creating practices in which
   stakeholders in Storytel's ecosystems associate value to Storytel's
   digital innovation. Our findings further highlight that the
   value-creating practices arising from the interactions of consumer and
   professional stakeholders in social media give rise to the hybridisation
   of value, where multiple values drawn from existing value categories
   become merged in the studied case. This study contributes to extant
   literature on management of innovation and information systems by (i)
   shedding light on how value is created by examining value-creating
   practices as a result of the interactions between stakeholders and (ii)
   examining the resulting merging of value categories within digital
   innovation ecosystems and thus exploring the hybridisation of value.},

Abstract = {The digitalization process and its outcomes in the 21st century
   accelerate transformation and the creation of sustainable societies. Our
   decisions, actions and even existence in the digital world generate
   data, which offer tremendous opportunities for revising current business
   methods and practices, thus there is a critical need for novel theories
   embracing big data analytics ecosystems. Building upon the rapidly
   developing research on digital technologies and the strengths that
   information systems discipline brings in the area, we conceptualize big
   data and business analytics ecosystems and propose a model that
   portraits how big data and business analytics ecosystems can pave the
   way towards digital transformation and sustainable societies, that is
   the Digital Transformation and Sustainability(DTS) model. This editorial
   discusses that in order to reach digital transformation and the creation
   of sustainable societies, first, none of the actors in the society can
   be seen in isolation, instead we need to improve our understanding of
   their interactions and interrelations that lead to knowledge,
   innovation, and value creation. Second, we gain deeper insight on which
   capabilities need to be developed to harness the potential of big data
   analytics. Our suggestions in this paper, coupled with the five research
   contributions included in the special issue, seek to offer a broader
   foundation for paving the way towards digital transformation and
   sustainable societies},

Abstract = {The rapid development of the new generation of digital technology has
   injected new vitality into the digital transformation (DT) and continued
   growth of enterprises. This paper selects data from China's A-share
   listed companies from 2010 to 2019 and uses transaction cost theory to
   empirically test the effect of enterprise digital transformation (EDT)
   on enterprise growth and its mechanism. Research has found that DT can
   significantly promote enterprise growth. The reduction of supply chain
   collaboration costs plays an important role as an intermediary mechanism
   in this process. At the same time, industry competition intensity,
   regional marketization level, and digital infrastructure level have
   played positive regulatory roles. In addition, when the enterprise's
   level of financing constraints is low and it is a manufacturing
   enterprise or state-owned enterprise, the promotion effect of EDT on
   enterprise growth is more significant. While expanding the research
   perspective and measurement methods of EDT, this paper integrates the
   strategic actions of EDT and the inter-enterprise collaboration costs of
   the supply chain into a unified theoretical framework, revealing a new
   theoretical mechanism for DT to promote enterprise growth. It also
   provides practical inspiration for relevant policy formulation and
   enterprise transformation and upgrading.},

Title = {Niche fitness of digital innovation ecosystems: evaluation, dynamic

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAR 20},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to explore the current development status,
   spatiotemporal evolution, and spatial effects of niche fitness in
   China's regional digital innovation ecosystems (DIEs), providing
   guidance for coordinated regional digital
   innovation.Design/methodology/approachUtilizing ecological niche theory,
   this study develops an evaluation system for DIEs niche fitness,
   calculates the niche fitness and evolutionary momentum across 31
   provinces (including municipalities and autonomous regions, excluding
   Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) of China from 2014 to 2022 and analyzes
   their spatiotemporal characteristics. And a dynamic spatial Durbin model
   is employed to assess spatial effects.FindingsThe findings reveal that
   from 2014 to 2022, the niche fitness of China's regional DIEs exhibited
   an overall upward trend, particularly in the eastern regions. Fitness
   was higher in the east and south and lower in the west and north.
   Resource and technology fitness steadily increased, while innovation
   community fitness slightly declined. Both overall and individual
   ecological element niche fitness demonstrate significant temporal
   inertia, with the overall niche fitness also exhibiting spatial
   spillover effects.Originality/valueThis study applies ecological niche
   theory to DIEs, offering a novel perspective on their dynamics and
   providing theoretical support for optimizing innovation policies,
   promoting regional balanced development and advancing the twin
   transition process.},

Abstract = {Innovation Management Software can promote Entrepreneurial Ecosystems by
   consolidating an organization's innovation programs, stakeholders, and
   resources in one place. In this study, we highlighted the digitalization
   of innovation processes. We focus particularly on the factors
   influencing the adoption of a specific class of software tools called
   Innovation Management Software (IMS) or Digital Innovation Management
   System to support innovation management methods and activities.
   Specifically, we address the two questions (a) which specific
   functionality drives the adoption of IMS tools, and (b) which services
   of IMS providers are valuable in supporting the adoption of IMS by
   organizations aiming to digitalize their innovation processes. By using
   an online questionnaire, we gathered survey data from 199 innovation
   managers of German firms. We used regression analysis to test our
   hypotheses. While the overall IMS adoption is considered to positively
   affect the new product development (NPD) efficiency, our results
   indicate that especially idea management functionalities and services
   for updates and upgrades improve the IMS adoption. Surprisingly,
   offering complementary consulting services together with IMS offerings
   to support the digitalization of innovation processes reduces the
   likelihood of IMS adoption. These findings are important for managers,
   consultants, and developers in order to choose and leverage the right
   options for improving the adoption of IT tools in the NPD process and
   therefore increase NPD performance and thus also promote Entrepreneurial
   Ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research was to explore the conditions under which
   digital innovation opportunities emerge in small and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs). The research answered the question of what
   capabilities are required to shape the exploitation of digital
   innovation, namely market offerings and the digital business process. To
   address the research question with a quantitative research method, data
   were collected through survey questionnaires distributed among 280 SMEs
   operating in the service and manufacturing industries in Finland. The
   results revealed that among four digital-related capabilities-namely
   human, collaboration, technical, and innovation capabilities-human,
   technical, and innovation capabilities contribute to market offerings,
   while human, collaboration, and technical capabilities contribute to the
   business process.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study explores how the high-end equipment manufacturing
   industry (HEMI) achieves intelligent development through the digital
   innovation ecosystem. While this industry urgently needs to achieve
   intelligent development through innovation breakthroughs, existing
   research lacks a deep analysis in conjunction with the digital
   innovation ecosystem. Considering the sophisticated nature of HEMI and
   the unique characteristics of the digital innovation ecosystem, this
   paper aims to uncover the innovation potential and synergetic
   development opportunities that arise from their
   integration.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses Dynamic
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to explore the evolving
   relationship between the digital innovation ecosystem and intelligent
   development in HEMI enterprises. Data from 60 HEMI enterprises were
   collected from 2015 to 2022, and the study window was divided into
   two-year intervals for analysis. Compared to traditional QCA methods,
   this approach overcomes the limitations of cross-sectional analysis,
   fully accounting for time's influence on causal relationships for more
   accurate results.FindingsThe study reveals that the digital innovation
   ecosystem of HEMI drives intelligent development through the coordinated
   interactions of its elements within each time window. Configuration
   paths and key driving factors evolve dynamically, reflecting the
   complexity of the ecosystem's role in driving intelligent development.
   The study suggests that enterprises dynamically adjust their strategies
   to different stages, enhancing the effectiveness of intelligent
   transformation.Originality/valueThe paper proposes and validates a
   digital innovation ecosystem framework for HEMI, systematically
   exploring its role in driving intelligent development. The study fills a
   research gap and extends innovation ecosystem theory by identifying core
   driving factors and their evolutionary trends through Dynamic QCA. It
   offers a new perspective on the dynamic role of digital innovation
   ecosystems in intelligent transformation.},

Title = {Impact of firm's supply chain network position on digital
   transformation: evidence from China},
Journal = {CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1348-1368},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Purpose - Given the complexity and increasing interdependence of supply
   chain networks, a broader perspective beyond a simple binary
   relationship is needed to analyse the impact of supply chain networks on
   firms. Based on social network theory, this study aims to explore the
   relationship between firms' network position in the supply chain network
   and digital transformation, as well as the moderating effects of
   structural holes and network partners' digitalisation.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study analyses a sample of Chinese
   A-share companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges
   for the period 2011-2020 using regression analysis to test hypothesised
   relationships.
   Findings - A firm's centrality in the supply chain network is positively
   related to its digital transformation, and that the firm's structural
   holes and the level of network partners' digitalisation can both
   strengthen the positive influence of network centrality on digital
   transformation. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that the
   positive effect of firms' network centrality on digital transformation
   is more pronounced in non-SOEs and upstream firms.
   Practical implications - In the pursuit of digital transformation, firms
   should recognise the significance of their position in the supply chain
   network and enhance their capability for information and resource
   acquisition by proactively strengthening their business cooperation with
   other network members. Moreover, firms should emphasise the value of
   open networks and their partners in supply chain networks.
   Originality/value - This study applies social network theory to
   investigate the role of a firm's external supply chain network in its
   digital transformation, clarifying the context and boundaries in which a
   firm's position in the supply chain network influences digital
   transformation. The results extend the research and theoretical
   perspective on digital transformation and the consequences of supply
   chain networks.},

Abstract = {The digital innovation ecosystem is a cornerstone of contemporary
   economic, technological, and social progress. A precise understanding of
   its efficiency and driving factors is crucial for enhancing the
   innovation capabilities of regional digital economies. This study
   evaluates the Digital Innovation Ecosystem Efficiency (DIEE) across 30
   provinces in China from 2018 to 2022, employing the Super-SBM model and
   the Malmquist-Luenberger model. Using Python-based machine learning
   techniques, the provinces are categorized into four heterogeneous
   groups, and the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) decision tree
   classification method identifies the primary driving factors of digital
   innovation development at both the overall and subgroup levels. The
   findings indicate that six factors, including the number of scientific
   and technical personnel and government performance, significantly
   influence DIEE across all provinces. Regionally, the number of internet
   broadband access ports and the total volume of telecommunications
   services exert the most significant driving effects on the All-round
   Developed Provinces group. Market institutions, internet broadband
   access ports, and urbanization levels significantly impact the Policy
   Developed Provinces group. In contrast, the total volume of
   telecommunications services and urbanization levels are critical for the
   Culture-Driven Provinces group and the Weak Provinces group,
   respectively. Based on these results, this study provides targeted
   strategies to enhance digital innovation capacity, offering theoretical
   insights and practical guidance for regions aiming to develop tailored
   digital economy initiatives.},

Title = {An Improved Group Decision-Making Method for Evaluating Knowledge
   Sharing Levels in Digital Innovation Ecosystems},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 AUG 12},
Abstract = {As digital technology undergoes rapid advancement and widespread
   adoption, a robust digital innovation ecosystem has steadily emerged and
   flourished. The level of knowledge sharing within the digital innovation
   ecosystem holds paramount significance in enhancing both the efficiency
   and the prowess of innovation across the entire system. Therefore, this
   paper presents an improved approach to interval intuitionistic fuzzy
   multi-attribute group decision making, specifically tailored to evaluate
   the level of knowledge sharing within the digital ecosystem for
   innovation. This method optimizes the aggregate operator of interval
   intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFS), introduces correlation coefficient
   into index weights, improves the order relation method (G1 method), and
   calculates the final index weights by combining the objective weights
   obtained by interval intuitionistic fuzzy entropy. At the same time,
   variance improved weighted scoring function is introduced into the
   ranking part, and the scheme consistency index under different indexes
   is calculated by combining the index weights. The research contributions
   of this paper are reflected in three aspects: Firstly, embedding the
   evaluation of knowledge sharing levels into the governance framework of
   the digital innovation ecosystem breaks through the evaluation
   boundaries of innovation in a single organization or region. Secondly,
   the development of the evaluation model effectively solves the problem
   of quantifying qualitative indicators in the process of knowledge
   sharing, providing a new methodological tool for the evaluation of
   complex systems. Thirdly, through empirical tests, the applicability of
   the evaluation framework has been verified, providing a quantitative
   decision-making basis for policymakers to optimize the allocation of
   innovation resources.},

   Advanced Collaboration in Digital Transformation},
Journal = {BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT},

Month = {2025 SEP 12},
Abstract = {Digital platforms, as key drivers of digital transformation, expand
   opportunities for business development-particularly for small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)-by enabling value-creating activities
   through digital resources. As infrastructures that mediate interactions
   and tasks, they have become increasingly central to management research,
   yet their impact on organizational performance remains underexplored.
   This study addresses this gap by investigating how external digital
   platforms influence collaboration, from bilateral collaboration on
   supply chain platforms to multidirectional ecosystem collaboration on
   industrial platforms, and their impact on sustainability performance.
   Drawing on survey data from Finnish B2B manufacturing and service firms,
   the findings reveal that while both bilateral and ecosystem
   collaboration are strengthened by digital platforms, only ecosystem
   collaboration improves sustainability performance. These results
   highlight the importance of broad cross-organizational collaboration and
   suggest that SMEs transition from supply chain-focused to
   ecosystem-oriented models. This study contributes to the
   digitalization-sustainability nexus and offers insights for
   collaborative management in SMEs.},

Journal = {TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS \& STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT},

Month = {2025 JUL 29},
Abstract = {Digital economy brings great changes to the effect of board networks.
   However, the relationship between board networks and innovation has not
   yet been sufficiently understood in the context of digital
   transformation. Therefore, from the perspectives of social network
   theory and digital empowerment, this study explores the effect of board
   networks on innovation performance and the moderating role of digital
   transformation. Using a dataset of listed companies from 2007 to 2020,
   we find that board network centrality and structural hole can
   significantly improve enterprise innovation performance, and enterprise
   digital transformation enhances the relationship between board networks
   and innovation performance. This study provides insights into the
   innovation effects of board networks in the context of digital
   transformation.},

Abstract = {The topic of industrial digital transformation (IDT) is garnering
   prominence in both industry and academia. Current discussions on IDT are
   most concentrated within specific business disciplines but remain
   fragmented, lacking a broader systemic perspective that integrates
   digital technology adopters, collaborative value co-creators, and the
   regulating external techno-economic environment. This paper explores
   innovation ecosystem theory to construct a
   ``technology-organization-market{''} integrated analysis framework,
   understanding IDT's multi-field linkage and cross-field coordination
   characteristics. We apply this exploratory framework to the Chinese
   urban rail transit industry as a case study, analyzing the interlinkages
   and collaborative dynamics in the digital transformation across various
   functional areas over the past decade. We observe that notable
   advancements in technological upgrading, organizational systems, and
   market performance within the industry, yet potential constraints at the
   technical field. Moreover, we observe a coordinated effect of chain
   optimization among different fields. However, a long-term negative
   impact is observed between technology and organization fields, possibly
   linked to recent industrial technology development decline.},

Abstract = {The interactions between developers and users are a vital driver of
   complementary innovation and further facilitate the emergence and
   evolution of digital innovation ecosystems. However, these interactions
   are somewhat overlooked in research on digital innovation ecosystems. To
   increase the understanding of their interrelationship, firstly, we
   explain the foundation of value co-creation between developers and users
   by introducing service-dominant logic (S-D logic). Then, we analyze the
   coordination mechanism of their value co-creation using an evolutionary
   game approach. There are three key findings obtained: First, the
   underlying logic behind their value co-creation is mutual benefit, and
   the coordination mechanism elaborates how they select participation
   strategies by carefully weighing benefits against costs. Second, their
   engagement behavior is influenced by each other, and their initial
   choices also determine the evolution outcome of the behavior under
   certain circumstance. Third, the involvement of developers and users is
   impacted by similar benefits and costs, such as additional benefits of
   adopting the active strategy unilaterally, free-riding benefits,
   additional costs of positive participation, and benefits of ecosystem
   synergy. However, factors related to platform owners, the loss caused by
   punishment due to passive participation and the benefits from being
   featured due to active participation, only affect developers' strategy
   choices directly. Finally, we discuss managerial implications of our
   findings.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a new metric for evaluating digital innovation
   in enterprise transformation using textual analysis of annual reports
   from U.S.-listed companies. Through network analysis and topic modeling,
   we identified 12 topics categorized into three main areas: digital
   technology innovation, customer-oriented digital strategy, and digital
   transformation in traditional business operations. Our research
   indicates that digital innovation strategies are critical for
   maintaining competitiveness and have shifted to a more innovation
   management-oriented approach. We also found differences in digital
   innovation strategies between companies and industries. Our study
   contributes to the theoretical significance of enterprise management and
   sustainable development.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the relationship between digital transformation and
   innovation became very popular topics, attracting extensive attention,
   and inspiring a number of documents. Although much literature discusses
   the intersection of both fields, most works offer neither a complete nor
   a truly objective overview of the current state of research. Therefore,
   there is a need for a comprehensive and objective review of research
   themes to analyze the intersection. For this purpose, based on the
   literature collected from the Web of Science (WoS) database published
   between 1994 and 2021, co-word analysis was carried out to explore
   research themes and identify the most salient themes in digital
   transformation and innovation research. The results of scientific output
   show that digital transformation and innovation is attracting increasing
   academic interest of scholars from many countries and different fields.
   The distribution of high-frequency keywords shows that the research in
   this field is multidisciplinary, including not only many economic and
   management fields, but also many classical theories and research
   methods. The clustering results of keywords reveal five clusters of
   themes: diffusion and adoption of technology and innovation, digital
   innovation management, digital transformation management, digital
   platform and ecosystem, and digital entrepreneurship and economy.
   According to the results of strategic diagram and performance analysis,
   digital innovation management and digital transformation management are
   the mainstream of research, while digital platform and ecosystem and
   digital entrepreneurship and economy have strong development potential.
   This study provides a snapshot of the thematic development of digital
   transformation and innovation research, enabling researchers to better
   master the current situation and suggesting the development trend in the
   future.},

Abstract = {The present study seeks to determine the connections among digital
   platform capabilities, digital market orientation, and circular supply
   chain resilience with sustainable digital innovation ecosystems. The
   study is designed to demonstrate how digital trust, digital openness,
   and other factors lay the foundation for developing circular supply
   chain resilience that can lead to sustainable innovation in a complex
   organizational context. An online survey of 293 employees was conducted
   in US and UK manufacturing firms. The findings show that digital
   platform capabilities and digital market orientation are positively
   related to a sustainable innovation ecosystem. The article also points
   out that digital openness and trust play a pivotal role in enabling the
   different supply chain stakeholders to collaborate, leading to resilient
   circular supply chain practices. The chain of digital openness, digital
   trust, and circular supply chain resiliency is the bedrock of
   sustainable innovation ecosystems. Companies that create digital
   platforms but are also oriented towards digital market orientation,
   transparency, and trust can develop resilient supply chains that help
   build a sustainable digital innovation ecosystem.},

Title = {Knowledge management and SMEs' digital transformation: A systematic
   literature review and future research agenda},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INNOVATION \& KNOWLEDGE},

Abstract = {This study aims to identify and explain different collaborative
   approaches, delineate external actors' roles, and examine the interplay
   between knowledge exploration and exploitation processes for digital
   transformation. We conducted a search of academic papers using research
   terms such as ``Digital{*}, Digital transfor{*}, industry 4.0 (I4.0),
   industry 5.0, knowledge exploration, knowledge acquisition, ecosystem
   collaboration{*}, knowledge networks, and open innovation{''} in both
   the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Altogether, 108 papers met the
   criteria (e.g., ABS 2 \& 2+ ranking of journals, only journal papers,
   and focusing on small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) digital
   transformation) for conducting a systematic literature review in this
   research. The results indicate that external actors play specific roles
   in supporting SMEs' digital transformation. We found that customers and
   suppliers push and encourage SMEs in their digital transformation, while
   coopetition can elicit greater technological benefits for SMEs with
   close technological and economic proximity. Intermediaries provide
   knowledge-brokering services, facilitate innovation processes, and
   enable technology transfer and capacitybuilding for SMEs' digital
   transformation. Government initiatives, such as favorable policymaking
   and financial support, are important in promoting and facilitating a
   collaborative environment for technology development among SMEs. This
   study's results present two distinct collaborative mechanisms that SMEs
   can utilize for digital transformation: (I) core value chain and network
   actors' collaborations, which provide linear processes for knowledge
   exploration and exploitation, and (II) ecosystem and innovation
   platform-based collaborations, in which SMEs adopt the ambidextrous
   approach as a nonlinear process for knowledge exploration and
   exploitation for digital transformation. Certain organizational-level
   factors (organizational capabilities, micro-foundations, operational
   capabilities, organization strategies, and culture) are important for
   SMEs' knowledge exploitation in digital transformation. The study also
   presents an integrated framework and offers directions for future
   research and important insights for practitioners.},

Title = {Exploring the digital innovation ecosystem from the perspective of
   platform-based startups: a case study in the film industry},

Abstract = {PurposeDigital innovation ecosystems (DIEs) are networks of
   interconnected stakeholders and organizations that collaborate without a
   rigid hierarchy to generate and develop new ideas, products and services
   supported by digital technologies (DTs). Although DIEs have become
   embedded in the daily operations of businesses, few studies explore them
   from a startup's perspective. To this end, our study analyses an
   artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, on-demand short film streaming
   platform called WeShort, founded in Italy in 2020, which successfully
   created and orchestrated a DIE.Design/methodology/approachA case study
   methodology was employed. Data were collected and analysed from both
   primary and secondary sources, including interviews with the CEO and CTO
   of WeShort, meetings and archival documents, conducted between December
   2023 and June 2024. These data provide insights into the DIE of the
   WeShort startup and its role as an orchestrator.FindingsThe findings
   describe the WeShort digital startup ecosystem, comprising key actors
   (such as filmmakers, technology providers, distributors and customers),
   essential resources or artifacts (including a multi-sided platform,
   digital technologies and a film library) and core activities (such as
   investment in technologies, collaboration between producers and
   distributors and the adoption of user engagement strategies). Open
   innovation practices are leveraged to enhance collaboration as well as
   the transfer of knowledge and technologies. Digital tools like AI, big
   data analytics, streaming platforms and blockchain are employed to
   create value.Research limitations/implicationsThis study contributes to
   the academic and managerial discourse on DIEs by emphasizing the
   importance of strategic alliances, investment in advanced technologies
   and adaptability to shifting market conditions.Originality/valueThe
   study aims to understand the core mechanisms that drive innovation,
   influence stakeholder interactions and shape the evolution of DIEs,
   ultimately demonstrating that even a startup can successfully
   orchestrate such an ecosystem.},

   models mutually reinforcing? The principal-agent conflict perspective},

Abstract = {This paper explores the implications of digitalization and business
   model innovation for the principal-agent conflict. Continuous digital
   transformation has recently become a feature sine qua non for companies.
   It is also stimulating business model innovation resulting in the
   growing adoption of ecosystem-based models. These trends may have
   significant implications for the principal-agent relationship, essential
   for understanding value creation by a firm. In order to analyze the
   impact of digital transformation, we use blockchain technology as a
   proxy. To measure the potential impact on the principal-agent conflict,
   we study management and shareholder-sponsored proposals at annual
   meetings. The level of shareholder involvement in governance is measured
   based on the number of shareholder-sponsored proposals received. In
   addition, we measure shareholder support for management-sponsored
   proposals. A sample of 2481 NYSE, Nasdaq and AMEX-traded firms for the
   period 2015-2019 is used. First of all, we show that digitalization per
   se has a mitigating impact on the agency conflict. Shareholders become
   more active, albeit not more hostile towards management. Secondly, we
   have identified the strongest impact in such sectors as information
   technology, communications, finance, and healthcare. These are the most
   significantly impacted by ecosystem-based business model innovation. We
   conclude that digitalization and ecosystem-based business models are
   mutually reinforcing in mitigating the principal-agent conflict.},

Abstract = {The role of links in knowledge transmission, from the external to the
   internal, highlights the need to explore whether director networks can
   promote digital innovation. Based on knowledge-based view, this study
   assesses the influence of director networks on digital innovation. With
   the analysis of data (from 2012 to 2019) from Chinese manufacturing
   listed companies, this study finds the following results: 1) director
   network centrality has a positive effect on digital innovation; 2)
   director network structural holes positively impact digital innovation;
   3) knowledge environment negatively moderates the relationship between
   director networks and digital innovation; 4) legal environment
   negatively moderates the relationship between director network
   centrality and digital innovation, but has no moderating effect on the
   relationship between director network structural holes and digital
   innovation. This study explores the relationship between director
   networks and digital innovation, providing both practical and
   theoretical significance to the field of digital innovation.},

Abstract = {Expertise in digital technologies is necessary, but rarely sufficient to
   generate digital innovation. The purpose of this paper is to explore how
   specialists rooted in digital and analog knowledge domains engage in
   cross-domain collaboration to jointly create digital innovation. Our
   analysis cross-examines the literature on knowledge integration and
   coordination by examining the role of boundary-spanning tools in fusing
   divergent types of knowledge. The empirical setting for our study is the
   development of digital serious games, a novel breed of digital learning
   products whose creation involves a wide range of gaming/digital and
   learning/analog expertise. Drawing on an in-depth qualitative study, we
   find that boundary-spanning tools such as prototypes, mockups, and
   whiteboards serve as important knowledge bridges buttressing the overall
   innovation process, enabling diverse experts to increasingly align and
   integrate their divergent thought worlds and knowledge domains.
   Furthermore, we find that the alternative interplay among digital and
   non-digital tools supports the gradual transformation of digital and
   analog expertise into a novel digital format. Taken together, our
   results explicate how boundary-spanning tools facilitate collaborative
   work among specialists rooted in diverse digital and non-digital
   knowledge domains. Our findings contribute to the literature on
   knowledge integration and coordination in cross-domain collaboration and
   digital innovation.},
