  abstract = {In the development of large-scale, integrated systems, consistent clarity and distribution of knowledge and relevant status are crucial to success. There are many existing methods and commercial tools for providing context and traceability from requirements and specifications to a system's artifacts, but these tools are often vendor locked, require access to cloud-based services, and necessitate high licensing costs. Furthermore, modern large-scale system development involves multiple business partners, each of which needs to ensure their teams have granular, role-based access to all relevant information without impediment; centralized warehousing and gatekeeping should not be handled by a single entity if the information is to remain readily accessible. Instead, a permissioned, distributed knowledgebase that avoids vendor lock-in enables a consistent, real-time view of information that provides equivalent context for developers and other stakeholders. ChaordicLedger, a free and open-source project, joins the transparency and smart contract aspects of distributed ledger technology with the storage capabilities of a distributed file system to fulfill this industrial application while allowing for industry-specific customizations.},

  abstract = {The profound integration of the digital economy and supply chain (SC) is a crucial guarantee for enhancing the resilience and security of new energy SC. Existing research mainly focused on the impact of digital economy on enterprise internal characteristics, with relatively limited attention to the study of multiagent collaboration in the SC. Based on data from listed new energy enterprises from 2011 to 2021, this article employed a two-way fixed-effects model to explore the impact and mechanism of the digital economy on the new energy supply chain configuration (SCC). The research reveals that: 1) Digital economy can significantly promote the SCC diversified development. After some endogeneity tests, the research results remain robust. 2) Digital economy can significantly enhance the downstream customer sales diversification, with limited impact on upstream supplier procurement. Nonstate-owned enterprises in a disadvantaged position are more inclined to promote SC diversification through digitization. This impact is more pronounced in the eastern region. 3) Digital economy can promote the diversified development by improving the supply–demand matching accuracy, reducing external transaction costs, and promoting technological innovation. The research conclusion and policy suggestions can provide a theoretical basis for digital transformation and diversified development of new energy enterprises.},

  abstract = {This study enters the debate on the interplay between digital technologies and the pursuit of sustainable development goals in organizations. The article investigates whether external pressures at the supply chain level push companies toward a digital and green (twin) transition, and how this effect differs according to company size and their collaborative relationships. Using a sample of fashion industry firms located in northeastern Italy, we propose and test a conceptual model by applying a moderated mediation analysis. Our proposed model suggests that collaborative partnerships between firms are essential in leveraging digital technologies for a green transition, emphasizing the importance of coordinating technological adoption across the value chain. Results confirm that adopting collaborative partnerships boosts companies’ willingness and ability to leverage digital technologies toward the green transition. Moreover, we found that the positive relationship between external pressures for technology adoption and firms’ collaborative behavior is moderated by firm dimension. On one hand, when external pressures for digital transformation increase, smaller firms tend to collaborate more frequently than larger ones. On the other hand, regardless of size, all firms demonstrate increased collaboration when facing the highest pressure levels. This study offers novel insights into the importance of interorganizational collaborations at the supply chain level in companies’ twin transitions.},

  abstract = {Blockchain is expected to have a transformational effect on supply chain and logistics due to its promise to improve the information flow between the supply chain partners. However, despite their high hopes, incumbent companies from supply chain and logistics are still struggling to deliver on this promise. In this explorative, qualitative interview study, we identify how incumbent companies try to make use of Blockchain in supply chain and logistics and we also analyze the barriers hampering them. The analysis of twenty-four semi-structured expert interviews and extensive secondary data collates a comprehensive picture of incumbent companies' activities around Blockchain adoption. We find that companies use Blockchain to drive digital transformation, constitute new business models and unify the industry through consortia. The main barriers to such solutions are a lack of technological usability and long-term uncertainties. The results of our study provide evidence for theoretical constructs and guide managerial practice.},

  abstract = {In today's digital age, many managers need to find new ways to manage collaborations where complementary partners co-create digital solutions. Collaborations with partners are at the center of digital projects, but managing these collaborations is challenging. This article objective is to investigate how research and development collaborations with scientific and business partners contribute to digital transformation. This has been achieved through an empirical investigation of three Brazilian manufacturers that are already on their journey toward digitalization. The research design involves multiple case studies and qualitative analysis, through data collection by interviews and questionnaires with participants from the tactical and strategic level followed by content analysis as well as nonparticipant observations. The findings indicate that the companies are at the early stage of building a digital ecosystem. However, they have already secured benefits from pursuing open innovation practices in the form of competitive advantage in operational processes. The results indicate that business success depends more on how (disruptive) technologies are developed and used by engaged people to add value to the enterprise, rather than simply adopting new technologies by themselves. Manufacturers need to act now to reshape their mindset, operational processes, and business models, respectively, enabling the understanding that: 1) organizational ecosystems are becoming more open and collaborative; 2) the value of data capture and analysis can be developed and used for data-driven learning, preventive and predictive capabilities, supporting decision-making; 3) customers' preferences need to be internalized to deliver customized experiences.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of digital technologies can revolutionize industrial companies’ operations through the procurement and application of digital solutions following a logic of digital servitization. However, industrial customers must refine their internal processes to exploit the potential servitization. In this transition, the procurement organization is pivotal in orchestrating relationships between its internal functions and supplier's ecosystems. Yet, traditional procurement processes are poorly suited to the evaluation and procurement of digital servitization offerings, hampering value cocreation between suppliers and customers. The purpose of this article is to investigate how procurement process models can be adapted to address the opportunities and challenges of digital servitization for industrial customers. The investigation is based on a case-study design, drawing on data collected through in-depth interviews with informants from 11 leading customers and 8 global suppliers. Based on the data analysis following the Gioia methodology, in this article, we describe key challenges with the traditional approach and identify novel procurement practices to capture value from digitalization. The article's key contribution is to propose a process model for Procurement 4.0, highlighting four phases: mapping digital opportunities, selecting digitalization partners, codeveloping digital solution contracts, and promoting continuous digital innovation. Furthermore, we define three overarching principles for procurement 4.0: nurture digital ecosystem generativity, orchestrate cross-functional integration, and leverage supplier capabilities through agile cocreation.},

  abstract = {Increasing reliance on digital technologies has led to a significant shift in how businesses operate, with many now relying heavily on digital platforms for effective planning, communication, sales, marketing, supply chain, and logistics management. In this context, knowledge sharing platforms enable academic–industry collaboration in which exchange of ideas, opinions, experience, and expertise brings collective intelligence in cooperative learning ecosystem thereby expediting decision making. However, establishing long-term commitment among the partners, allocation of time and resources for sharing tacit knowledge, collaboration among partners with different strategic priorities, and real-time knowledge sharing capabilities are essential for effective and rapid learning in knowledge sharing platforms. The present article will examine these benefits and challenges in knowledge sharing and its impact on supplier selection platforms in Asian automakers. The findings of this article will be helpful for researchers and practitioners intending to explore the role of cooperation in knowledge sharing and digital transformation amid competitive environment prevalent in the automotive industry. The potential supplier database is first examined for qualifying the capability requirements put forth in this article and further prioritized using a multicriteria decision-making technique and analytic hierarchy process. The article results reveal that the manufacturer has highly prioritized firms’ financial transparency for supplier evaluation followed by the suppliers’ cost control, quality control, and manufacturing capabilities. The article has significant theoretical and practical implications for developing robust supplier evaluation criteria for automobile industry and a digital ecosystem for original equipment manufacturers in making supplier related decisions.},

  abstract = {The exceptional COVID-19 crisis has shown the fragility of the health supply chain and the need for its digital transformation. However, digitization initiatives for healthcare supply chain have focused mainly on the hospital as a central point of consumption as well as on the relationship between the hospital and its suppliers. Thus, unlike previous studies that have focused on the digitalization of the internal supply chain of hospitals, this article is centered on the digitalization of external trajectories, particularly, the home care medical supply chain. This perspective complements the hospital-centric model, in which logistics activities are analyzed only from the point of view of the focal actor, which is the hospital. In order to understand this contemporary phenomenon embedded in a local context, we have conducted an in-depth case study. Based on an enriched model of the digital supply chain developed by Queiroz et al. (2021), this article offers for the first time a deep understanding and digitalization initiatives of the home care medical supply chain. The research proposals can guide logistics managers and nurses on their initiatives of digitalization of the home care medical supply chain, and further strengthen the healthcare development. This article draws the attention of healthcare stakeholders to the importance of efforts in the digitalization of external trajectories, thus allowing the healthcare system to adapt to the growing needs of elderly people and people with physical or mental disabilities.},

However, the paper does not emphasize strategic competitive advantage through supplier coordination (dimension 4), and the treatment of boundary-spanning capabilities, while present, is not explicitly developed as a core analytical framework. The paper is a case study focused on digitalization implementation rather than on the orchestration mechanisms and strategic capabilities that are central to the research question. It would be most relevant as a contextual example of digital transformation in supplier networks but does not deeply explore the underlying orchestration mechanisms and boundary-spanning capabilities that drive transformation outcomes.}
