  abstract={In today's digital age, many managers need to find new ways to manage collaborations where complementary partners co-create digital solutions. Collaborations with partners are at the center of digital projects, but managing these collaborations is challenging. This article objective is to investigate how research and development collaborations with scientific and business partners contribute to digital transformation. This has been achieved through an empirical investigation of three Brazilian manufacturers that are already on their journey toward digitalization. The research design involves multiple case studies and qualitative analysis, through data collection by interviews and questionnaires with participants from the tactical and strategic level followed by content analysis as well as nonparticipant observations. The findings indicate that the companies are at the early stage of building a digital ecosystem. However, they have already secured benefits from pursuing open innovation practices in the form of competitive advantage in operational processes. The results indicate that business success depends more on how (disruptive) technologies are developed and used by engaged people to add value to the enterprise, rather than simply adopting new technologies by themselves. Manufacturers need to act now to reshape their mindset, operational processes, and business models, respectively, enabling the understanding that: 1) organizational ecosystems are becoming more open and collaborative; 2) the value of data capture and analysis can be developed and used for data-driven learning, preventive and predictive capabilities, supporting decision-making; 3) customers' preferences need to be internalized to deliver customized experiences.},

  pages={2465-2479},
  abstract={The healthcare industry is continuously evolving with innovative discoveries and therapies, and at the same time, there is a decline in the research and development productivity leading to an increased cost for payers, providers, and patients. Despite the benefits that digital technologies can have on healthcare innovation, such a highly regulated industry often relies on proven-established technologies and organizational procedures that can be at odds with the new logics of digital innovation. In this article, we will be introducing a digital innovation management (DIM) framework that guides the pursuit of digital innovations in a phase-appropriate and incremental setup (e.g., scale, costs, risks, value evaluations, policies, and resources). The framework is designed and validated through an iterative process of continuous adaptation with local practices in a biopharmaceutical company. DIM provides practical guidance to drive digital innovations that entail different logics compared to traditional innovations, by improving the visibility of the digital innovation process and increasing organizational confidence in pursuing digital innovations and enhancing decision-making effectiveness.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of information and communication technologies, digital transformation has already been underway in various fields around the world. In order to construct digital government and promote the modernization process of national management system and management capability, governments of different Countries have started the digital transition process. Government digital transformation has fascinated many experts and scholars, while there is little literature on the relations between digital transformation and government performance. Combining dynamic capability theory and cooperative agility variables, the analysis framework and corresponding structural equation model were constructed. An empirical study on the impact of digital transformation on government performance was made using systematic review and questionnaire survey materials. The results show that sensing capability, seizing capability, transformation capability and partnering agility have significant positive effects on government performance. Moreover, partnering agility plays a mediating role in the interactions of sensing capability, transformation capability and government performance variables. This paper enriches the research achievements in the field of government digital transformation and provides both theoretical and practical supports for the improvement of government performance.},

  abstract={Because of rapid advances in information technology, firms are facing challenges in providing value to their customers and are struggling to cocreate value in their supply chains. The purpose of this study, which was theoretically based on value cocreation, was to investigate the key explicit and implicit drivers of value cocreation by supply chain partners. Semistructured interviews and a case study of a supply chain comprising five companies were used to gather the primary data. This study discovered strategies that can help firms cultivate internal and external linkages, particularly as they relate to information sharing. This study contributes to the value cocreation theory in digital transformation in the context of linkages among supply chain partners. This study highlights the role and importance of customer and supplier engagement in value cocreation. The findings reveal the operational strategy, functional resources, and digital transformation that give rise to value cocreation between supply chain partners. This study contributes to the value cocreation theory regarding digital transformation in the context of linkages between supply chain partners.},

  abstract={Increasing reliance on digital technologies has led to a significant shift in how businesses operate, with many now relying heavily on digital platforms for effective planning, communication, sales, marketing, supply chain, and logistics management. In this context, knowledge sharing platforms enable academic–industry collaboration in which exchange of ideas, opinions, experience, and expertise brings collective intelligence in cooperative learning ecosystem thereby expediting decision making. However, establishing long-term commitment among the partners, allocation of time and resources for sharing tacit knowledge, collaboration among partners with different strategic priorities, and real-time knowledge sharing capabilities are essential for effective and rapid learning in knowledge sharing platforms. The present article will examine these benefits and challenges in knowledge sharing and its impact on supplier selection platforms in Asian automakers. The findings of this article will be helpful for researchers and practitioners intending to explore the role of cooperation in knowledge sharing and digital transformation amid competitive environment prevalent in the automotive industry. The potential supplier database is first examined for qualifying the capability requirements put forth in this article and further prioritized using a multicriteria decision-making technique and analytic hierarchy process. The article results reveal that the manufacturer has highly prioritized firms’ financial transparency for supplier evaluation followed by the suppliers’ cost control, quality control, and manufacturing capabilities. The article has significant theoretical and practical implications for developing robust supplier evaluation criteria for automobile industry and a digital ecosystem for original equipment manufacturers in making supplier related decisions.},

  abstract={Digital transformation of services (DTSs) are seen as an opportunity for building dynamic capabilities, strategic renewal, collaborative approach, changing organization culture, entering new markets, and gaining new customers. Understanding users’ behavior, preferences, and cultural shifts needed for DTS is challenging. Organizations must develop new skills, infrastructure, and capabilities to effectively design, develop, and implement digital service offerings. To fill such gaps, the research explores various enablers and their inter-relationships that can empower DTS. The study deploys “Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM)” and MICMAC to analyze complex relationships between different enablers and classify them into clusters based on impact ability. The proposed model can lead to improvements in service delivery, including faster response times, personalized services, greater accessibility, and innovation to increase digital competencies. By leveraging the study findings, organizations can improve their service offerings, respond to changes in demand more quickly, maintain high levels of service quality, drive innovation, foster collaboration, and deliver more effective customer-centric services. The decision-makers, service providers, entrepreneurs, managers, technology developers, marketing professionals, consultants, and academicians would benefit from study outcomes in formulating and implementing strategies for digitally transformed services to exploit public value-creation opportunities.},

  abstract={The growth in intelligent machines entering the workplace continues to challenge organizations’ digital transformation efforts. Various applications of simple to complex algorithms allow computerized systems to take on and automate an increasing number of tasks previously undertaken by human workers. Robo-advisors (RAs) in the financial sector serve as an excellent example of technological versatility and what is to come. RAs are platforms defined by a set of algorithms that offer wealth management advice online. To understand how human workers are affected by progressively intelligent machines, this article looks at the impact of RAs on human financial advisors. Through a systematic review, we present state of the art literature and examine interactions of human and digital component. Our findings illustrate possible automation scenarios for financial advisors working with RAs, the human value added, and the skills the future workforce will require. We further suggest a future research agenda. This article adds to the digital transformation literature at the intersection of workplace automation, service provision, and human–machine interaction. The aim is to provide and provoke new ideas for successful implementation and use of intelligent machines along with skilled people in a supportive work environment.},

  pages={15555-15568},
  abstract={As small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to adopt digital technologies, open innovation could provide a solution by utilizing external and internal technological resources across organizational boundaries to help SMEs overcome digital transformation deficits. This research investigates the direct effect of two open innovation strategies, namely, external technology acquisition and external technology exploitation, on digital transformation of emerging-market SMEs. It also examines how firm age and size moderate such effect. Analyses of 320 dual-source (one general manager and one production manager), time-lagged data from 160 Thai electronics SMEs suggest that external technology acquisition and external technology exploitation positively affect digital transformation. Moreover, as SMEs age, the positive effect of external technology acquisition and external technology exploitation on digital transformation becomes weaker and stronger, respectively. Furthermore, the positive effect of external technology exploitation on digital transformation appears to be stronger for larger SMEs than for smaller ones. The findings suggest that, to achieve digital transformation, early-stage SMEs’ managers should practice external technology acquisition; once SMEs mature, they should engage more in external technology exploitation. Likewise, as firm size does not moderate the effect of external technology acquisition on digital transformation, even small SMEs can attain digital transformation by effectively acquiring external technology.},

  pages={1486-1503},
  abstract={Digital supply chains (DSCs) can be useful in unlocking supply chains to gain competitive advantage as a driver of growth, while enabling rapid response, supporting novel technology-driven approaches, and creating innovative products and services. Partner selection (PS) is one of the crucial tasks in the successful digitalization of supply chain. However, the selection of a suitable partner is not an easygoing process and is mostly associated with complexity. Various criteria are considered during the partner evaluation process. This paper delivers an efficient evaluation process to assess alternative DSC partners. The proposed approach integrates the Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs), analytic hierarchy process, and complex proportional assessment under a group decision making environment for the first time in the literature. PFSs can depict experts' evaluations with a richer structure, allowing for a more representative decision making. A case study from Turkey is conducted to validate proposed approach. This study contributes to the existing literature by developing a new evaluation model to improve DSC PS process and by proposing a new hybrid PFSs-based framework. This paper can be useful to practitioners and researchers to better understand DSC PS problem and designing effective DSC partner evaluation systems.},

  abstract={Collaboration between university and industry can improve knowledge exchange and innovation, which is required for driving digital business transformation in organisations. This paper discusses the results of a case study that was conducted to investigate the personal (‘lived’) experiences of both industry practitioners and academics from the STEM academic unit at the University of Enterprise in Australia, regarding the barriers to building trusting knowledge-related collaborative relationships. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with sixteen academics and industry representatives to elicit their views. We found that university and business leaders must overcome barriers to establish higher numbers of University-Industry Collaboration (UIC) agreements, including limited resources, lack of capabilities and the absence of university support. However, they must also address the challenges facing individual academics and industry professionals, such as conflicting interests and expectations, and limitations to academics’ career progression. The paper discusses how the recently established Enterprise Hub at the University supports collaboration and fostering healthy relationships between academic staff and industry partners. The findings will provide guidance to other universities and businesses to establish such supportive entities at their institutions to drive innovation and digital business transformation initiatives.},

  abstract={The global energy transition is increasingly driven by hydrogen energy, making digital green innovation crucial for hydrogen energy enterprises. This article explores effective strategies for these enterprises to select digital green innovation partners and provides actionable guidance for their transformation and development. First, an evaluation index system is developed using fuzzy set theory, grounded in the principles of digital green innovation partner selection for hydrogen energy enterprises. Next, a dual-combination weighting evaluation method is proposed, integrating combination weighting theory and field theory to build a decision model that supports partner selection for these companies. The model is then applied in a real-world case analysis of Baotailong, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in addressing digital green innovation challenges within hydrogen energy enterprises. The study concludes that a green and digital transformation approach, guided by a fuzzy decision-making model, enables hydrogen energy companies to identify suitable innovation partners. This approach not only aligns with the broader trends of socio-economic development but also enhances the companies’ core competitiveness.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},

  pages={140112-140127},
  abstract={Digitalization is now playing an empowering role in the process of servitization, which changes the approach to product and service delivery for service-oriented manufacturers (SM) and sales service integrators (SSI). However, few studies concentrate on the pricing and coordination of the product service supply chain (PSSC) under digital transformation. The purpose of the study is to explore how digitalization supports servitization and enables value co-creation among stakeholders in the supply chain by influencing pricing decisions. We take the automobile manufacturing industry as an example, and construct a two-stage Stackelberg game model of PSSC considering the product network externality and service digitalization level. The optimal pricing strategies under centralized and decentralized decisions are given, and the coordination contract of PSSC is designed. The results show that the optimal values of variables in the digital environment are higher in general than in the non-digital environment. The emphasis of SM on digitalization is positively related to the product network externality, the service delivery advantage, the digitalization level, and the profit of advanced services. We also find that basic and advanced services of SSI are gradually losing the potential to create value, whereas the advanced service of SM continues to generate higher profits. Service delivery advantages of SM and SSI can enhance the profitability of advanced services. The dual revenue-sharing contract can realize the coordination of PSSC. The results contribute to related studies on digitalization, servitization, as well as pricing and coordination in the product service supply chain.},

  pages={5030-5043},
  abstract={This study aims to identify and analyze factors determining the adoption of digital technologies in SMEs. Drawing on the technology–organization–environment framework, the study highlights enabling factors from three different contexts and hypothesizes their relationship with digital technology adoption. The data used were collected from 15 346 European Union and non-European Union SMEs to test an ordered logit regression model that highlights the factors associated with an increased level of digital technologies adoption in SMEs. The empirical results show that the technology context (IT infrastructure and digital tools) along with the existing level of innovation are the main drivers that act as stepping stones in digital technology adoption. Corporate regulation, available skills, and financial resources (as organizational variables) also play a significant role in the adoption decision. Unexpectedly, the influence of the environmental context is marginal. The implications of this study are emphasized for theory and practice, laying a foundation for further empirical studies in this field. Managerial relevance statement: This article reviews the empirical research on digital technologies adoption and examines the drivers of such adoption in SMEs. The factors identified provide guidance for practitioners adopting digital technologies in SMEs, by suggesting they assess the readiness of their firms before investing in digital technology. This research helps advance the conversation on digitalization drivers especially by bringing the discussion into the organization boundaries, as our findings highlight the predominance of organizational drivers over the technological and environmental ones. SMEs have to overcome the challenges associated with constructing an IT infrastructure capable of implementing new technologies. Indeed, while striving to adopt new digital technologies (e.g., AI, big data, IoT), many SMEs are still unprepared. Therefore, rather than adopting mimetic behaviors based on external pressure, SMEs that aim for digitalization should first assess their existing technologies, and further develop a meticulous technological roadmap that includes skills upgrades and investments in upskilling employees’ capabilities. Therefore, developing a fully integrated strategic approach is crucial before the adoption of digital technologies},

  abstract={The digital transformation of society presents potential solutions to achieve goals, such as ending poverty, mitigating climate change impacts, promoting human equality, and other challenges identified in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. At the same time, the digital transformation is responsible for new challenges—such as fake news, Internet addiction, and cyberbullying—and for potentially promoting new sources of inequality and discrimination. For its complex, uncertain and evaluative nature, the digital transformation is one of the “grand challenges” of our time. Robust actions are lines of action that allow organizations to tackle grand challenges and formulate specific robust strategies (Ferraro et al., Organization Studies, 2015). This article investigates the practices and mechanisms included in the robust actions and strategies to improve information society assessments (ISA), i.e., measurements of the digital transformation of society. We investigated Cetic.br, a Brazilian ISA organization, to learn how ISA contributes to respond to the grand challenge of digital transformation from a management perspective. Beyond the measurement processes that represent a robust action to tackle the grand challenge of the digital transformation of society, the study of the Cetic.br case help us to improve the understanding on robust strategies implementation to the level of practices and mechanisms comprising them.},

  abstract={Schools, universities, and other educational entities are increasingly aware of the untapped potential of digital transformation, an essential process for increasing efficiency and collaboration, and reducing costs and errors in the management of at-scale training systems. In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.},

  title={A Digital Strategy Development Framework for Supply Chains}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={70},

  pages={2493-2506},
  abstract={Digitalization has provoked rapid changes in the operational landscape, thus requiring prompt decision-making across end-to-end supply chains. Notwithstanding the fact that technology is the epicenter of digital transformation, more often than not, organizations fail to effectively adopt innovative applications, harness their full potential, and realize growth and competitiveness. Therefore, this article argues that a unique strategy formulation process is required to embrace digitalization in manufacturing supply chains. However, within the context of manufacturing networks, strategy formulation approaches are limited. To this end, this article adopts a case study approach to extract tacit knowledge across 12 multinational companies within the theoretical boundaries of corporate strategy development. Research findings and a theoretically derived framework demonstrate that there are three typologies of digital strategy development for manufacturing supply chains, namely: 1) top-down; 2) bottom-up; and 3) mixed. Every identified typology is supplemented with three determinant criteria for digital supply chain strategy formulation, i.e., number of suppliers, market demand, and product types. Noteworthy, the aforementioned strategies are context-dependent. This article contributes to the operations management field by formulating a novel strategy development framework for digital supply chains. The proposed framework, synthesized via strategic management theoretical views and primary evidence, can provide a reference point as companies chart their current and future digital supply chain strategy state.},

  abstract={The locus of innovation has shifted from mechanical advances to digital solutions. By emphasizing the importance of user needs, Design Thinking is apt to develop human-centered innovation, including digital solutions. Using two representative examples from 21 Design Thinking projects spanning the gamut of mechatronic to fully digital solutions, we report on critical incidents as opportunities and challenges of applying Design Thinking in a digital context. In the case of mechatronic solutions, we identified opportunities related to improved collaboration and higher quality prototyping as well as in innovative business models, which in turn created challenges in managing stakeholders. In the fully digital context, we observed opportunities in improved needfinding and the ability to offer individualized products. Conversely, we uncover difficulties in imagining digital features, estimating their feasibility, and correctly setting the fidelity of prototypes. Based on these observations, we discuss the intangibility of digital artifacts as enabler and inhibitor of Design Thinking in a digital context.},

  abstract={Digital management system is widely used in the business activities of enterprises. Practice has proved that the implementation of the manufacturing execution system (MES) can better monitor and manage the production process, improve the production efficiency of enterprises, and effectively realize zero defect management (ZDM). Against this background, the influencing factors of implementing MES in ZDM enterprises in digital transformation were obtained by using the literature extraction-Delphi method, and the relationship between the factors was analyzed by using the system dynamics simulation model in this study. It is found that different from the existing research works on the implementation of MES in enterprises, staff preparation and level of information sharing are the most influential factors and play an important role in the implementation of MES in ZDM enterprises. Equipment preparation and client preparation followed closely, with supplier implementation team and scale infrastructure conditions playing a key role in providing capability support. This finding provides the direction for enterprises to improve the relevant implementation measures in time to ensure the effective implementation of MES in ZDM enterprises, and also provides a breakthrough for relevant researchers to find valuable research fields.},

  year={2023},

  pages={135659-135695},
  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed nursing education worldwide. Due to the globally applied restrictions of interpersonal interactions, many educational institutions transitioned from traditional to computer-aided nursing education pedagogies. However, an obligatory change, this digital transformation in nursing education, has been deemed promising by students and academics, yet raising concerns about the effectiveness of innovative nursing pedagogies. Hence, this systematic literature review aims to investigate the state of the art of computer-aided nursing pedagogies in the post-COVID-19 era and provide recommendations for further research investigation. Specifically, it utilises a mixed methods approach to examine (1) the evolution of computer-aided nursing pedagogies before and after COVID-19; (2) their effectiveness against traditional methods in terms of knowledge, skills acquisition and self-efficiency; and (3) nursing students’ experiences and opinions when exposed to computer-aided nursing education pedagogies. For this purpose, several databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL Complete, Academic Search Elite, IEEE, ACM, Scopus, ERIC and Cochrane Library (Controlled trial requests) were searched, initially retrieving 802 articles published between 2013-2023. After removing duplicates, exclusion criteria and assessment for eligibility, the number of articles assessed for eligibility was reduced to 78 conducted in 20 different countries. The articles comprised quantitative research (n=37), including Randomised Control Trials (n=14) and Quasi-experimental studies (n=23), and qualitative research (n=41) including observational studies (n=14), mixed-methods methodological design (n=15), pilot studies (n=7) and conference papers (n=5). Moreover, this SLR utilised the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodological approach for conducting a mixed-methods systematic review (MMSR) and provided a narrative synthesis of all studies. The results of this mixed-methods SLR suggested that the post-COVID-19 era has enabled the implementation of a variety of computerised systems in nursing education, including desktop-based systems, mobile applications, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality and holograms, haptics, Artificial Intelligence-enabled chatbots and systems, smart glasses and multimodal systems. The authors found that these computer-aided nursing education pedagogies were superior to traditional nursing pedagogies regarding acquiring knowledge, skills, and self-efficiency. However, the generalisability of the above findings should be interpreted with caution due to variations in sample size and effect size established via Hedges’ g calculations among the 35 quantitative articles. Nevertheless, nursing students’ experiences and opinions were encouragingly positive. Further research is needed to incorporate more realistic and memorable scenarios and examine the effects of computer-aided nursing educational pedagogies on long-term knowledge gains and the effective learning domain.},

  pages={7311-7324},
  abstract={The evolution of industries through vertical disintegration has long been the focus of attention and concern of management scholars and managers. However, most existing studies are based on transaction cost economics and address vertical disintegration choices as firm-level decisions. By integrating transaction costs economics with the resource-based view of the firm and moving from static analysis of individual transactions to dynamic analysis of the causes of change within an industry, the article develops an integrative framework that explains where and how vertical disintegration occurs. Drawing on the cultural heritage industry, the results show that vertical disintegration choices reflect differences in the way the institutional context favors (or prevents) the creation and capture of value enabled by technological change. On the one hand, firms with low strategic autonomy and limited flexibility in acquiring resources and competencies tend to evolve toward vertical disintegration decisions when digital platforms enter the industry—Google in our case. On the other hand, organizations with a high degree of strategic autonomy and high flexibility in acquiring resources and competencies opt for vertical integration strategies. In practical terms, the framework provides a tool for managers to understand whether their industry is prone to vertical disintegration.},

  abstract={Supply chain integration (SCI) plays a crucial role in the success of healthcare organizations by facilitating strategic collaboration with partners and the cooperative management of intra and interorganizational processes to achieve effective and efficient flows of information, products, and services. Despite the adoption of digital technologies to support SCI, evidence suggests that healthcare organizations face challenges in integrating their supply chains. To shed light on this issue, this research aims to investigate empirically the main obstacles hindering health organizations from achieving SCI, despite having suitable technology. An exploratory multiple-case study was conducted involving the pharmaceutical supply chains of 30 Italian healthcare organizations. The study identified seven key barriers to digitally enabled SCI in the healthcare field, primarily associated with a lack of motivation, resistance to change, a noncost-effective mindset, and a lack of initiative from health authorities or dominant players in the ecosystem. Contrary to expectations, the availability of financial resources and technologies played a minor role, at least in the case studies considered. These findings offer insights for healthcare organizations seeking to overcome obstacles to achieving SCI.},

  year={2023},
  volume={70},
  number={12},
  pages={4175-4190},
  abstract={The rapid development of digital technologies can revolutionize industrial companies’ operations through the procurement and application of digital solutions following a logic of digital servitization. However, industrial customers must refine their internal processes to exploit the potential servitization. In this transition, the procurement organization is pivotal in orchestrating relationships between its internal functions and supplier's ecosystems. Yet, traditional procurement processes are poorly suited to the evaluation and procurement of digital servitization offerings, hampering value cocreation between suppliers and customers. The purpose of this article is to investigate how procurement process models can be adapted to address the opportunities and challenges of digital servitization for industrial customers. The investigation is based on a case-study design, drawing on data collected through in-depth interviews with informants from 11 leading customers and 8 global suppliers. Based on the data analysis following the Gioia methodology, in this article, we describe key challenges with the traditional approach and identify novel procurement practices to capture value from digitalization. The article's key contribution is to propose a process model for Procurement 4.0, highlighting four phases: mapping digital opportunities, selecting digitalization partners, codeveloping digital solution contracts, and promoting continuous digital innovation. Furthermore, we define three overarching principles for procurement 4.0: nurture digital ecosystem generativity, orchestrate cross-functional integration, and leverage supplier capabilities through agile cocreation.},

  abstract={The profound integration of the digital economy and supply chain (SC) is a crucial guarantee for enhancing the resilience and security of new energy SC. Existing research mainly focused on the impact of digital economy on enterprise internal characteristics, with relatively limited attention to the study of multiagent collaboration in the SC. Based on data from listed new energy enterprises from 2011 to 2021, this article employed a two-way fixed-effects model to explore the impact and mechanism of the digital economy on the new energy supply chain configuration (SCC). The research reveals that: 1) Digital economy can significantly promote the SCC diversified development. After some endogeneity tests, the research results remain robust. 2) Digital economy can significantly enhance the downstream customer sales diversification, with limited impact on upstream supplier procurement. Nonstate-owned enterprises in a disadvantaged position are more inclined to promote SC diversification through digitization. This impact is more pronounced in the eastern region. 3) Digital economy can promote the diversified development by improving the supply–demand matching accuracy, reducing external transaction costs, and promoting technological innovation. The research conclusion and policy suggestions can provide a theoretical basis for digital transformation and diversified development of new energy enterprises.},

  abstract={With digitalization and big data integration, traditional organizational boundaries between manufacturing, procurement, logistics, and the entire supply chain are becoming increasingly blurred. Procurement 4.0, at the core business, is expected to change what organizations buy and how they buy. While the P4.0 concept is not alien to the industry, particularly the manufacturing sector, it has rapidly gained traction in recent years. Its full implementation trackway is yet unknown. Thus, the study's objective is to comprehensively present various theoretical underpinnings, methodologies, frameworks, models, linkages with the broader ecosystem, benefits, and challenges, along with critical research gaps to provide thoughtful recommendations on the future research scope of procurement 4.0. The study adopted a systematic literature review approach on procurement 4.0, following PRISMA guidelines, to examine 74 high-quality research articles on this subject. Various authors have utilized multiple approaches, particularly conceptual frameworks and theories, to research this concept and its applications in public procurement, construction, manufacturing, and other industries. The research remained fragmented and patchy in the dedicated context of procurement 4.0, although it covers a wide base in a broader supply chain context. From the research front's standpoint, the most prominent theme demands more empirical analysis of the proposed conceptual frameworks and substantiation of findings. It also highlights the rigorous research required to analyze the dark side of P4.0’s technological implementation. The applications of P4.0 should also be separately researched in the manufacturing, services, or nonprofit sector, as the findings from one cannot be generalized for all.},

  abstract={Digital service transformation is part of organizational change focuses on enhancing digital service through the use of frontier technologies to generate new value. In public sector, this transformation is used to enhance public value such as citizen satisfaction, cost reduction, and bureaucratic efficiency. Digital service transformation framework for public sector is essential in order to achieve bureaucracy reform and minimize mal-administration in government service. This research aimed to provide framework for implementing digital service transformation in public sector through two approaches: theoretical approach using meta-synthesis method and empirical approach using surveys and interviews. The synthesis process is conducted on the lifecycle, stages, activities, and its supporting components. The results of meta-synthesis were additionally supported by survey conducted with thirty-five practitioners of digital service transformation in eleven public sector institutions, followed by interviews with eight of them. The survey and interview results showed that the designed framework was relevant to the needs of transformation activity in the government agencies of The Republic of Indonesia. The designed framework is expected to serve as a guideline for stakeholder in public sector, especially in Indonesia, in implementing digital service transformation in their respective units.},

  pages={337-364},
  abstract={This article discusses the process of digitization in the implementation of public policy within developing countries, its critical success factors, challenges, and lessons learned from case studies. Public administration can improve efficiencies, transparency, and effectiveness through the infusion of digital technologies into processes implicated in the making, execution, and evaluation of public policies. Key success factors identified include robust digital infrastructure, clear strategic vision and leadership, effective stakeholder engagement, capacity building, and a supportive regulatory framework. In light of these potential benefits, developing countries experience enormous challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, political instability, socio-political resistance, and gaps in digital literacy. Through a review of empirical case studies from countries such as Estonia, South Korea, China, Bangladesh, and Rwanda, the article identifies key lessons that can inform the digital strategies of other developing nations. The discussion addresses the challenges of sustaining digital infrastructure, including ongoing maintenance costs, the need for continuous technology updates, and the risks of obsolescence. Furthermore, the article explores the significance of capacity building, public-private partnerships, and evolving regulatory frameworks in ensuring the long-term viability of digital policies. The future directions proposed underscore the necessity of adopting adaptable, resilient, and well-governed digital infrastructures to fully realize the benefits of digital public policy in the context of developing countries.},

  abstract={The concept of Industry 4.0 originates from the will to introduce the benefits of digital computation into new and existing industrial plants to save time, materials and energy. The digital transformation requires that all machinery of the production line are connected together and with the enterprise applications, to capture and analyze data across all manufacturing stages. Then, such collected data can be exploited to take strategic decision on the production and to monitor it, reacting to unexpected behaviors and thus reducing downtime and maintenance costs. This article aims at supporting production engineers approaching digital transformation by exemplifying its key elements on a real life scenario, the Industrial Computer Engineering laboratory of the University of Verona. First of all, the article discusses network design, as communication is an enabler of the other technologies. Network is realized through automatic network synthesis from requirements and characteristics of the production line data flow. Then, the paper discusses data collection and the construction of a digital twin monitoring power consumption of the production line, with the goal of detecting any discrepancy between real time data and digital twin data. This allows to trigger an early intervention on the line, to guarantee an effective maintenance.},

  abstract={Companies are trying to keep up with the growing number and variation of digital systems. As the number of systems grows, so does the number of integrations, the connections and data flows between systems. This makes integration management more difficult. To improve integration management, companies are using cloud-based integration platforms, but with varying success. To understand the challenges and decision-making processes of integration platform projects, we interviewed 20 software vendors and 20 customers who have recently completed an integration platform project. In our grounded theory analysis, we discovered that software vendors and their customers had repeatedly faced similar cloud-based platform challenges in their integration platform projects. These included requirements, pricing, features, and data management challenges. In addition, we discovered that there is no common understanding of the meaning and features of a cloud-based integration platform, which can also mislead companies during their decision-making. We also form a categorization for the cloud-based integration platforms and discover their advantages and disadvantages. Our results highlight the crucial need for businesses to understand and carefully examine their cloud-based integration solutions. The summary of the results serves as the foundation for our cloud-based integration platform decision model, which helps navigate through common challenges, avoid extra costs and delays, and ensure projects align with their overall needs and strategies.},

  number={},
  pages={12001-12014},
  abstract={Tackling grand challenges calls for collaborative innovation approaches that can gather various stakeholders around a common goal. One such approach receiving growing scholarly attention is collaborative crowdsourcing. By enabling crowds to collaboratively share and integrate their knowledge, perspectives, and partial solutions, collaborative crowdsourcing changes the role of ordinary people from passive receivers to active creators of innovative solutions for addressing grand challenges. However, our understanding of the knowledge sharing and integrating processes in temporary online crowds is limited and calls for further research. Through a netnographic analysis of an online crowdsourcing platform tackling problems around the Covid-19 pandemic, we provide a detailed account of the knowledge integration processes as they unfold on the platform over time. We identify fourteen activities that individuals engage in and relate these activities to six subprocesses that constitute the knowledge integration process on a collaborative crowdsourcing platform for addressing grand challenges. Our insights contribute to the research on collaborative crowdsourcing by showing the importance of crowds establishing common ground, not only around solutions but also around the different aspects of the problem. Furthermore, when addressing grand challenges, connecting contributions emerges as an important intermediate step between the diverging and converging cycles previously identified in crowdsourcing studies. Finally, our article highlights the importance of (collaborative) crowdsourcing initiatives in making participants feel part of something greater by “building a collective.”},

  abstract={In the development of large-scale, integrated systems, consistent clarity and distribution of knowledge and relevant status are crucial to success. There are many existing methods and commercial tools for providing context and traceability from requirements and specifications to a system's artifacts, but these tools are often vendor locked, require access to cloud-based services, and necessitate high licensing costs. Furthermore, modern large-scale system development involves multiple business partners, each of which needs to ensure their teams have granular, role-based access to all relevant information without impediment; centralized warehousing and gatekeeping should not be handled by a single entity if the information is to remain readily accessible. Instead, a permissioned, distributed knowledgebase that avoids vendor lock-in enables a consistent, real-time view of information that provides equivalent context for developers and other stakeholders. ChaordicLedger, a free and open-source project, joins the transparency and smart contract aspects of distributed ledger technology with the storage capabilities of a distributed file system to fulfill this industrial application while allowing for industry-specific customizations.},

  abstract={This study enters the debate on the interplay between digital technologies and the pursuit of sustainable development goals in organizations. The article investigates whether external pressures at the supply chain level push companies toward a digital and green (twin) transition, and how this effect differs according to company size and their collaborative relationships. Using a sample of fashion industry firms located in northeastern Italy, we propose and test a conceptual model by applying a moderated mediation analysis. Our proposed model suggests that collaborative partnerships between firms are essential in leveraging digital technologies for a green transition, emphasizing the importance of coordinating technological adoption across the value chain. Results confirm that adopting collaborative partnerships boosts companies’ willingness and ability to leverage digital technologies toward the green transition. Moreover, we found that the positive relationship between external pressures for technology adoption and firms’ collaborative behavior is moderated by firm dimension. On one hand, when external pressures for digital transformation increase, smaller firms tend to collaborate more frequently than larger ones. On the other hand, regardless of size, all firms demonstrate increased collaboration when facing the highest pressure levels. This study offers novel insights into the importance of interorganizational collaborations at the supply chain level in companies’ twin transitions.},

  abstract={This article presents an innovative approach to fostering twin transitions, leveraging the creation and management of digital entrepreneurial ecosystems. In such ecosystems, both digital and deep technologies are developed to address complex societal challenges, thanks to the dynamic capabilities of their key actors. The empirical foundation for these propositions is anchored in a comprehensive case study analysis of the “Future Farming” initiative, a collaborative venture between the University Ca’ Foscari of Venice (Italy) and the company ZERO. In the Future Farming, a distinctive eco-systemic collaboration model underpinned by a digital platform allows the collaboration among industry leaders, start-uppers, and academic researchers to enable the development of twin transition unicorns that leverage deep-technologies. The case study underlines the need for a new micro foundation approach to dynamic capabilities to allow value cocreation and the establishment of new hybrid organizations, responding to market needs, aiming at sustainability, and encompassing the latest technological advancement. Moreover, it highlights a new academic entrepreneurship approach, with universities and scientists able to translate their scientific discoveries into real-world applications.},

  abstract={Through this study, a vehicle to enhance existing education curricula was demonstrated, by exposing students to research-informed educational activities and to experience the key digital systems used in different industrial sectors. Digital skills are in high demand across the globe, with over a million digitally skilled people required by 2022 in the U.K. alone. With digital skills being vital to a country’s economy, there is a need to develop the higher education sector to prepare students for a digitized future—a key area of future graduate skills. The overall aim of the project was to train students in cutting-edge digital technologies through two separate week-long boot camps, targeting undergraduate and postgraduate cohorts. To this end, an educational project primed by research-informed teaching was successfully organized at the University of Birmingham in collaboration with the industry, to directly enhance the student’s personal development in the digital field, the findings of which are reported in this article. Researchers and practitioners presented practical applications of various digital technologies during the boot camps.},

  volume={49},

  pages={973-990},
  abstract={The study of human values in software engineering (SE) is increasingly recognised as a fundamental human-centric issue of SE decision making. However, values studies in SE still face a number of issues, including the difficulty of eliciting values in a systematic and structured way, the challenges of measuring and tracking values over time, and the lack of practice-based understanding of values among software practitioners. This paper aims to help address these issues by: 1) outlining a research framework that supports a systematic approach to values elicitation, analysis, and understanding; 2) introducing tools and techniques that help elicit and measure values during SE decision making processes in a systematic way; and 3) applying such tools to a month-long research sprint co-designed with an industry partner and conducted with 27 software practitioners. The case study builds on lessons from an earlier pilot (12 participants) and combines in-situ observations with the use of two values-informed tools: the Values Q-Sort (V-QS), and the Values-Retro. The V-QS adapts instruments from values research to the SE context, the Values-Retro adapts existing SE techniques to values theory. We distil implications for research and practice in ten lessons learned.},

  year={2023},

  pages={2203-2214},
  abstract={Digital transformation is increasingly reliant on service-based operations in fog networks. The latter is a geo-dispersed form of the cloud, extending resources closer to end-users for improved privacy and reduced latency. The dispersion leverages diversity of compute-network capacities and energy prices, while promotes the coexistence of multiple providers. This drives variation in operational cost, coupled with limited information sharing across providers. Consequently, there is a critical need for an orchestration solution that preserves autonomy and optimizes operational cost across domains, while meeting service requirements. This article proposes a novel service-based fog management and network orchestrator (sbMANO), which utilizes service metadata in enabling multi-provider resource management. The sbMANO is empowered with a novel optimization algorithm for service-based joint request mapping and response routing. The algorithm acts on partial information and preserves the edge for delay-critical services. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated analytically for delay-aware and delay-agnostic variants. The results show that both achieve near-optimal performance in maximizing user satisfaction with minimum operational cost. Furthermore, the delay-aware variant outperforms the agnostic counterpart, with higher user satisfaction and lower operational cost.},

  abstract={Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are pivotal in the digital transformation of organizations, offering an integrated platform to digitalize processes across various business functions, such as finance, supply chain, and human resources. Despite their expansive capabilities, these systems often present usability challenges due to their complexity and vastness. The integration of Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a novel opportunity to enhance user interaction with ERP systems, streamlining processes and improving accessibility through natural language interfaces. Conversational AI refers to technology that enables machines to engage in human-like dialogue, understanding and responding to user queries in natural language. However, embedding Conversational AI into ERP systems is not without challenges due to the vast and intricate landscape of ERP systems, which are comprised of hundreds of thousands of business processes, involve hundreds of millions of lines of code and cater to diverse industry-specific requirements. This paper explores the critical research question: How to systematically develop Conversational AI in ERP systems? The paper conducts the business requirements and proposes a comprehensive solution framework. This framework is implemented and evaluated using real-world ERP use cases, demonstrating its potential to significantly enhance ERP user engagement and operational efficiency, while setting the stage for future innovations in enterprise software usability.},

  abstract={Federated learning (FL) is considered a de facto standard for privacy preservation in AI environments because it does not require data to be aggregated in some central place to train an AI model. Preserving data on the client side and sharing only the model’s parameters with a central server preserves privacy while training an AI model of higher generalizability. Unfortunately, sharing the model’s parameters with the server can create privacy leaks, and therefore, FL is unable to meet privacy requirements in many situations. Furthermore, FL is prone to other technical issues, such as data poisoning, model poisoning, fairness, client dropout, and convergence issues, to name just a few. In this work, we provide a multifaceted survey on FL, including its fundamentals, paradigm shifts, technical issues, recent developments, and future prospects. First, we discuss the fundamental concepts of FL (workflow, categorization, the differences between centralized learning and FL, and applications of FL in diverse fields), and we then discuss the paradigm shifts brought on by FL from a broader perspective (e.g., data use, AI model development, resource sharing, etc.). Later, we pinpoint ten practical issues currently hindering the viability of the FL landscape, and we discuss developments made under each issue by summarizing state-of-the-art (SOTA) literature. We highlight FL partnerships with two or more technologies that either improve practical aspects/issues in FL or extend its adoption to new areas/domains. We pinpoint various trade-offs that exist in an FL ecosystem, and the corresponding SOTA developments to mitigate them. We also discuss the latest studies that have been proposed to make FL trustworthy and beneficial for the community. Lastly, we suggest valuable research directions towards enhancing technical efficacy by guiding researchers to less explored topics in FL.},

  abstract={Smart information and communications technology and its extensive use usher significant changes in all spheres of society. As a result, there emerge new business models, new organisational and management forms, as well as new demands, both in the private and the public sectors. As far as the developments in the administrative paradigm are concerned, increasingly more governments are making efforts to move from e-government to smart government. The Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, artificial intelligence are the technologies which enable smart government and make it possible to develop and provide smart services to citizens, organisations and public agencies in a variety of fields. Taking into account the current incipient stage of blockchain and IoT (BIoT) adoption and of the transition to smart government, our study focuses on the identification of the main characteristics of smart government, as well as on the main benefits and challenges related to BIoT in e-government. Moreover, in order to capture the impact of BIoT on e-government, the study proposes a conceptual model in which we define and describe a set of hypotheses on how the BIoT adoption in e-government will impact: 1) the government provision of public services to the citizens (G2C), 2) to the business environment (G2B) and 3) the intergovernmental processes and relations (G2G). The proposed model relies on the current stage of research and is validated through the data collected from a Romanian survey. The study uses the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM model) in order to test and analyse the impact of the identified variables on the use the BIoT based public services. The results indicate that the use of BIoT may contribute to delivering higher quality public services. Furthermore, our paper also lists the main recommendations that may step up the transition to smart government.},

  pages={6968-6981},
  abstract={In contrast to the digital transformation of the incumbents, born-digital small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) embrace digital logic in the organization's design, processes, and governance from the very start. So far, scholars have focused on the digital transformation of the incumbents; thus, little is known about how dynamic capabilities, collaborative innovation, and firm performance interact in the context of born-digital SMEs—a new generation of digital firms with no legacy of the incumbent firm. Therefore, the study's research question is how dynamic capabilities and collaborative innovation affect the performance of born-digital SMEs. We aim to investigate the impact of the dynamic capabilities of born-digital SMEs on their performance when collaborative innovations mediate it. The empirical research was based on 268 complete viable responses from born-digital SMEs in the U.S., Sweden, and Lithuania. The study results show that dynamic capabilities' effect on born-digital SMEs' performance is more potent when mediated by collaborative innovations. Furthermore, the study highlights that although the impact of dynamic capabilities on partnership networks and relational collaboration is significant, only relational collaboration significantly affects the performance of born-digital SMEs. Our study contributes to the management of technology literature by advancing knowledge on dynamic capabilities and collaborative innovation of born-digital SMEs. In addition, we are exposing the limited role of partnership networks in born-digital SMEs' superior performance and spotlighting the significance of relational collaboration—cocreating innovative products and services and sharing the cocreated value among the relevant partners.},

  pages={2652-2663},
  abstract={Today, more and more enterprises are embarking on a digital transformation where most of their applications are hosted in the Cloud. As a result, a reliable Wide Area Network (WAN) has become a primary need to interconnect their distributed branch offices and data centers that accommodate those applications. Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) represents the most promising technology solution for next-generation enterprise networks, being able to increase network agility and reduce costs. In this paper, we present an experimental SD-WAN solution capable of running and optimizing delay-sensitive high-priority services, such as real-time video streaming, while minimizing downtime caused by network failures. This solution comprises a monitoring and a traffic engineering system for SD-WAN. The first consists of a Transport-layer Passive Monitoring (TPM) system based on extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology with the goal of monitoring TCP flows; the second consists of an application, running inside the SD-WAN controller, with the goal of orchestrating the network traffic in consideration of the monitoring measurements by ensuring rapid recovery and resilience in case of unexpected congestion events. We validate our solution over two SD-WAN testbeds: the first is hosted in our laboratory at Politecnico di Milano, while the second is deployed in a municipal network of an Italian city. Results show that our SD-WAN solution can increase the overall service availability while meeting the stringent QoS requirements of delay-sensitive services.s},

  abstract={The deepening of digital transformation has led to an increasing amount of data from industries being transmitted over the Internet. However, packets in plaintext originally designed for transmission in private networks suffer from significant security threats on the Internet. Unfortunately, existing encryption schemes, such as the representative TLS, are difficult to be applied to these industrial protocols due to their specific requirements and conditions such as low latency requirements and restricted operating environments. In this paper, we present a high-performance encryption/decryption middlebox called GuardBox to provide confidentiality and integrity for packets. GuardBox is expected to transparently encrypt/decrypt packets sent/received by protected industrial equipment with low latency and supports almost any application-layer protocol. To do that, we design a high-performance packet I/O framework and an optimized encryption/decryption scheme for GuardBox. More importantly, we use commodity trusted hardware, Intel SGX, to ensure the security of keys and the encryption/decryption process. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that GuardBox can provide confidentiality and integrity for packets transmitted over the Internet with low latency and a near-native throughput.},

  abstract={The role of digitalization in industrial and entrepreneurial processes has acquired more and more attention in the last few years. The technologies and platforms behind the digital economy allow generating a global connection between consumers, employees, enterprises, and industries. Therefore, there is a growing interest in digital knowledge and technological tools in the context of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) from an open innovation (OI) perspective. Indeed, the OI model and related initiatives that refer to external exploitation of knowledge are fully in line with the needs of an integrated digital business model. Although the characteristics of digital technologies suggest OI as a strategic option, due to its characteristic of channeling mutual information flows, the relationship between I4.0 and the OI initiatives is still unclear. This article aims to find evidence from the literature and understand how I4.0 technologies can support OI initiatives. The article investigates the evolution of OI and I4.0 paradigms through a systemic literature review process. Afterwards, we highlight the link between OI and I4.0 by building a taxonomy and a framework of I4.0 technologies supporting OI practices. Finally, we conclude and outline the gaps that emerged from the literature and avenues for future research.},

  abstract={An aging population, a lack of qualified medical staff, and rising costs in the healthcare sector pose major challenges to many societies. Implementing digital solutions in hospitals is a promising response to these challenges without compromising the quality of patient care. Nevertheless, the adoption of digital solutions in the healthcare environment is progressing more slowly than might be desirable. Adopting a paradox perspective, we study tensions in the relationship between the providers of digital solutions and hospitals (their customers) that can explain the slow uptake. Drawing on 39 interviews, our findings reveal nine tensions related to the three dimensions of a business model (value proposition; value creation and delivery; value capture). We also identify four coping strategies that allow solution providers to deal with these tensions, especially when building digital solutions in new ecosystems. The strategies to cope with paradoxical tensions in interorganizational relationships include accommodation, avoidance, concession, and confrontation.},

  abstract={Healthcare data is highly sensitive and must be safeguarded. Personal and sensitive data, such as names and addresses, is stored in Encrypted Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This paper proposes a Blockchain-based distributed application platform for Bangladesh’s public and private healthcare service providers. The proposed application framework enables users to create secure digital agreements for commerce or collaboration by leveraging data immutability and smart contracts. As a result, all stakeholders can collaborate securely over the same Blockchain network, taking advantage of their data’s openness and read/write nature. The proposed application is made up of various application interfaces for various stakeholders. The proposed solution employs Hyperledger Fabric and Blockchain to ensure data integrity, privacy, permissions, and service availability. In the application portal, each user has a profile. The creation of a unique identity for each user, as well as the establishment of digital information centers across the country, has greatly aided the process. This application collects health data from each user in a systematic manner, which is useful for research institutes and healthcare-related organizations. For this application, a national data warehouse in Bangladesh is feasible, and various healthcare-related analyses can be performed using the collected data, assisting the strategy and planning department in making informed decisions regarding the healthcare sector in Bangladesh. Because Bangladesh has both public and private healthcare providers, a simple digital strategy is essential for all organizations to accomplish their services. This study proposes a solution to achieve this goal.},

  abstract={Low-code (LC) technology and hyperautomation (HA) are reshaping Business Process Management (BPM) practice by enabling faster, more agile, and more accessible process design and automation. This technological convergence challenges the relevance of the traditional BPM lifecycle, which is increasingly misaligned with the proactive, user-centric capabilities now available in LC-BPM environments augmented with HA capabilities. This study introduces the intelligent BPM (iBPM) lifecycle – an empirically grounded model that redefines the traditional BPM approach in light of new technological advances. The iBPM lifecycle model reflects HA capabilities and LC democratization, integrating them into BPM practices to proactively enhance user experience and efficiency in BPM projects. The model was developed using a modified Delphi method with ten experts from leading LC-BPM vendors and validated through formative evaluation workshops in manufacturing, financial services, and IT consulting organizations. Findings show that the iBPM lifecycle unifies process design, application design, and process observability within an integrated, augmented environment, reducing reliance on professional developers and accelerating process transformation. By explicitly incorporating LC and HA capabilities, the iBPM lifecycle provides both a theoretical revision of the traditional BPM lifecycle and a practical roadmap for intelligent process management and automation, strengthening BPM’s strategic role in organizational and digital transformation initiatives.},

  pages={108-120},
  abstract={Several automotive industry players are investing in the implementation of Industry 4.0 (I4.0). However, the adoption of I4.0 technologies in automotive supply chains (SCs) is still not uniform, which limits the value creation of advanced technologies. In particular, suppliers, which play a crucial role in the automotive SC, often struggle in their I4.0 projects. Since their adoption of I4.0 technologies can significantly impact the overall performance and value creation within the SC, it is crucial to gain insights into actions and strategies that can support suppliers’ I4.0 implementations. Building on a multiple case study approach, this article aims at providing guidance to prospective I4.0 adopters by investigating the organizational-level actions that support I4.0 projects, the financial capital and KPIs typically used by suppliers, and the resulting impact of I4.0 technology implementation on business performance. Evidence shows that the planning stage of I4.0 initiatives, from the organizational-level actions to the investment strategy, is a complex and strategic stage for ensuring success. Equally important are the external collaborations, which ensure that firms are in line with technological innovation and market needs. Finally, results show that the implementation of more advanced I4.0 technologies is correlated with a more robust improvement in business performance.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly strained online food delivery services (OFDS) globally. This has challenged OFDS businesses to redesign and deploy technologies to meet customer demand. The purpose of this article is to identify the optimal factors contributing to customer experience with OFDS services during a black swan event such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We followed a four-step research design to identify the optimal factors for OFDS. First, we identified the major episodes in the OFDS process. Second, these episodes were evaluated by customers using the sequential incidence technique. Third, we used an orthogonal design to analyze the episodes at different levels based on customer preferences. Finally, we used the Taguchi approach to calculate the signal-to-noise ratios and identify the optimal factors and their preferred levels. We classify the optimal factors into customer-oriented and service-provider-oriented propositions. The option to select the delivery person and delivery conditions was found to be the most optimal customer-oriented attribute. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the study and suggest major avenues for digital transformations in OFDS for better customer experience.},

  number={},
  pages={184940-184952},
  abstract={This study examines the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting imminent electrical safety incidents using extensive smart meter data. The proliferation of smart meters in residential settings has led to the generation of large-scale datasets, which provide valuable insights into household electricity consumption trends. However, early detection of hazardous electrical conditions, such as overloads or short circuits, remains an arduous challenge. This research proposes a novel methodology that utilizes LLMs to analyze real-time electricity usage data, employing a defined text-based encoding of numerical values to identify potential electrical hazards. By training the model on historical consumption data from over 700 households, this approach aims to uncover subtle patterns that may indicate precursors to unsafe electrical conditions. Results indicate that LLMs significantly improve predictive accuracy for identifying such incidents, thus offering a proactive strategy for mitigating electrical safety risks. This work contributes to the fields of energy management and electrical safety by equipping utility providers and homeowners with early warnings and actionable insights that support the prevention of electrical safety accidents.},

  title={Ontology Building for Cyber–Physical Systems: Application in the Manufacturing Domain}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={17},
  number={3},
  pages={1266-1282},
  abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the manufacturing domain can be deployed to support monitoring and analysis of production systems of a factory in order to improve, support, or automate processes, such as maintenance or scheduling. When a network of CPS is subject to frequent changes, the semantic interoperability between the CPSs is of special interest in order to avoid manual, tedious, and error-prone information model alignments at runtime. Ontologies are a suitable technology to enable semantic interoperability, as they allow the building of information models that lank machine-readable meaning to information, thus enabling CPSs to mutually understand the shared information. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, we present an ontology building method that is tailored toward the needs of CPSs in the manufacturing domain. For this purpose, we introduce the requirements regarding this method and discuss related research concerning ontology building. The method itself is designed to begin with ontological requirements and to yield a formal ontology. As the reuse of ontologies and other information resources (IRs) is crucial to the success of ontology building projects, we put special emphasis on how to reuse IRs in the CPS domain. Second, we present a reusable set of ontology design patterns that have been developed with the aforementioned method in an industrial use case and illustrate their application in the considered industrial environment. The contribution of this article extends the method introduced, as a postconference paper, by a detailed industrial application. Note to Practitioners-With growing digitalization in industry, the exchange and use of manufacturing-related data are becoming increasingly important to improve, support, or automate processes. Thus, it is necessary to combine information from different data sources that have been designed by different vendors and may, therefore, be heterogeneous in structure and semantics. A system that plans a maintenance worker's daily schedule, for instance, requires information about the status of machines, production plans, and inventory, which resides in other systems, such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) or databases. When creating such information systems, accessing, searching, and understanding the different data sources is a time-intensive and error-prone procedure due to the heterogeneities of the data sources. Even worse, this procedure has to be repeated for every newly built system and for every newly introduced data source. To allow for eased access, searching, and understanding of these heterogeneous data sources, ontology can be used to integrate all heterogeneous data sources in one schema. This article contributes a method for building such ontologies in the manufacturing domain. Furthermore, a set of ontology design patterns is presented, which can be reused when building ontologies for a domain.},

  abstract={The use of mobile phone apps for digital transactions has increased by leaps and bounds due to the proliferation of smart phones at affordable prices and rapidly growing ease of access to quality internet services. This study uses the technology acceptance model and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as lenses to explore: 1) the impact of mobile apps’ security features, integrity (trust & privacy), transparency and utilities (facilities & usefulness) on the behavioral intention to use mobile apps and 2) the mediating influence of social influence on the relationship between the aforementioned variables. The results of exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regression highlight significant positive relationships between security, integrity and utilities, and the intention to use mobile payment apps for digital transactions. Social influence partially mediates the relationship between security and users’ intention but completely mediates the relationship in the case of integrity and utilities. Thus, in the era of digital transformation, service providers should focus on improving security and integrity features along with making payment apps more user-friendly.},

  title={The Impact of Supply Chain Risk Complexity and Concentration on Financial and ESG Performance in China's Semiconductor Industry}, 
  year={2026},
  volume={73},
  number={},
  pages={390-401},
  abstract={In this article, we aim to explore the complex interactions that surround supply chain risk complexity (SCRC) and its effects on both financial and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in the chip industry. It seeks to demonstrate how SCRC, influenced by supply chain concentration, impacts firm performance metrics. Drawing on resource dependence theory and the resource-based view, this study constructs a panel of 364 Chinese-listed semiconductor firms for 2013–2022 and creates a novel SCRC index using natural language processing. Ordinary least squares, fixed effects, and an event-study specification centered on the 2018 export control shock confirm that the patterns persist after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and time effects. The analysis reveals a complex relationship wherein increased supply chain concentration heightens SCRC, which in turn has a dual impact: enhancing financial performance while negatively affecting ESG outcomes. Furthermore, SCRC serves as a significant mediator between supply chain concentration and performance metrics, showcasing the important role of risk disclosure in strategic supply chain configurations. The findings provide semiconductor executives with a clear framework: minimize dependence on any single partner, institutionalize comprehensive risk-disclosure practices, implement predictive digital tools, and preserve ESG resources to achieve efficiencies driven by concentration without compromising sustainability credentials.},

  abstract={Worldwide cities are involved in a digital transformation phase specially focused on sustainability and improving citizen's quality of life. However, such objectives are hard to achieve if the migration of the urban processes are not performed following a common approach. Under the paradigm of smart city, different Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have been deployed over urban environments to enable such digital transformation. However, actual implementations differ from one city to another, and even between services within the same city. As a consequence, the deployment of urban services is hindered, since they need to be tailored to each city. In addition, the isolation of urban services obstructs its optimization, since it cannot harness contextual information coming from other services. All in all, it is necessary to implement tools and mechanisms that allow us to ensure that city solutions and their vertical services are interoperable. In order to tackle this issue, different initiatives have proposed architectures that homogenize the interaction with smart cities from different angles. However, so far the compliance with such architectures has not been assessed. Having this in mind, in this work we present a validation framework, developed under the umbrella of the SynchroniCity project, which aims to verify that interfaces and data exposed by cities are aligned with the adopted standards and data models. In this regard, the validation framework presented here is the technical enabler for the creation of an interoperability certificate for smart cities. To assess the benefits of the validation framework, we have used it to check the interoperability of 21 smart city deployments worldwide that adhered the SynchroniCity guidelines. Afterwards, during an open call a total number of 37 services have been deployed over such SynchroniCity instances, thus confirming the goodness of uniform and validated smart cities to foster service replicability.},

  pages={132448-132454},
  abstract={In recent years, with the rapid growth of the digital currency industry, blockchain technology has attracted wide attention, and its research mostly focuses on the protection of economic security and privacy. In order to study the application and development mechanism of currency products, this work investigates the practical application of digital currency products under blockchain technology at the present stage, and analyzes the potential security risks. The Artificial Immune Algorithm (AIA) is an intelligent method to imitate the function of the biological immune system, which provides a new solution for solving complex distributed problems. Firstly, a blockchain digital currency product is proposed based on AIA. Secondly, taking the credit risk of innovation risk in financial currency products as an example, the Diffie-Hellman (DH) with blockchain technology is used. Finally, the generation and optimization of the plan are realized, and an innovative risk plan is proposed for blockchain digital currency products on the basis of AIA. The results show that: (1) The improved AIA implements a guided AIA with adaptive parameter update. (2) The digital signature technology using the DH algorithm has a stronger anti-attack ability than the traditional blockchain digital signature technology. It improves the security of blockchain digital currency. This work has successfully established the risk-immune system of digital currency product innovation, laying a theoretical foundation for the innovation and development of blockchain digital currency products in the future.},

  pages={6481-6494},
  abstract={The exceptional COVID-19 crisis has shown the fragility of the health supply chain and the need for its digital transformation. However, digitization initiatives for healthcare supply chain have focused mainly on the hospital as a central point of consumption as well as on the relationship between the hospital and its suppliers. Thus, unlike previous studies that have focused on the digitalization of the internal supply chain of hospitals, this article is centered on the digitalization of external trajectories, particularly, the home care medical supply chain. This perspective complements the hospital-centric model, in which logistics activities are analyzed only from the point of view of the focal actor, which is the hospital. In order to understand this contemporary phenomenon embedded in a local context, we have conducted an in-depth case study. Based on an enriched model of the digital supply chain developed by Queiroz et al. (2021), this article offers for the first time a deep understanding and digitalization initiatives of the home care medical supply chain. The research proposals can guide logistics managers and nurses on their initiatives of digitalization of the home care medical supply chain, and further strengthen the healthcare development. This article draws the attention of healthcare stakeholders to the importance of efforts in the digitalization of external trajectories, thus allowing the healthcare system to adapt to the growing needs of elderly people and people with physical or mental disabilities.},

  abstract={Blockchain is expected to have a transformational effect on supply chain and logistics due to its promise to improve the information flow between the supply chain partners. However, despite their high hopes, incumbent companies from supply chain and logistics are still struggling to deliver on this promise. In this explorative, qualitative interview study, we identify how incumbent companies try to make use of Blockchain in supply chain and logistics and we also analyze the barriers hampering them. The analysis of twenty-four semi-structured expert interviews and extensive secondary data collates a comprehensive picture of incumbent companies' activities around Blockchain adoption. We find that companies use Blockchain to drive digital transformation, constitute new business models and unify the industry through consortia. The main barriers to such solutions are a lack of technological usability and long-term uncertainties.

  pages={3795-3806},
  abstract={Corporate accelerators are becoming increasingly important in introducing innovative methods for companies to generate value. Despite their growing importance, the specifics of their activities in value creation, especially in orchestrating and managing network collaborations for companies and startups, are still poorly understood. This study attempts to fill this knowledge gap by describing a set of orchestration activities that shape the synergy between companies and startups in an accelerator program and correlating these activities with value creation. Empirical evidence was collected through a qualitative case study of a corporate accelerator program. The results show that orchestration activities inherent in the accelerator's network are critical to driving value creation. We identified five such orchestration activities: 1) knowledge mobility and innovation sustainability, which leads to novelty; 2) innovation appropriability and 3) network stability for lock-in, keeping members in the network and increasing relationship quality; 4) innovation coherence as a source of complementarity; and 5) leveraging resources for efficiency. Additionally, our research shows that value for startups begins with expanding their network reach, which encourages the development of new skills, the introduction of novel concepts, and the expansion of existing knowledge. The findings from this study contribute to the theoretical discourse on the importance of network orchestration in the context of corporate accelerators. By integrating orchestration activities into the broader network narrative, we gain insights into the central connecting role of accelerators and their practical relevance.},

  year={2024},
  volume={71},
  number={},
  pages={11315-11327},
  abstract={Amidst recent supply chain disruptions triggered by pandemics and crises, the imperative of bolstering supply chain security and resilience is escalating. Central to this endeavor is the augmentation of risk-taking capabilities among enterprises at supply chain nodes. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), coupled with the burgeoning concentration within supply chains present promising avenues for enhancing corporate risk-taking capacity (CRTC). However, a conspicuous gap exists in the relationship between enterprise AI transformation, supply chain concentration, and CRTC. This study constructs a panel simultaneous equation model to contrast the direct impact of corporate AI transformation on CRTC with its indirect influence, facilitated by the reduction of supply chain concentration (Scii). The results indicate that the overall effect of corporate AI transformation on CRTC is positive. In the indirect path, an increase in supply chain concentration effectively enhances CRTC, and firms exhibiting higher CRTC also show a preference for supply chains with centralized configurations. All of these interactions involve heterogeneity in property rights and firm life cycle stages. This study broadens the understanding of factors influencing CRTC at the supply chain level and sheds light on the policy implications of enterprise AI transformation. It offers valuable insights for corporates in shaping their risk management strategies and contributes to the discourse on the advancement of emerging technologies and supply chain practices.},

  abstract={As industries increasingly integrate Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, standardization is crucial for ensuring effective implementation. This study addresses gaps in the application of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), a key standard for industrial standardization, and examines its role in digitising the industrial sector. Despite the recognised importance of RAMI 4.0, unclear application procedures often hinder its adoption and effectiveness. This study conducts a thorough literature review to explore RAMI 4.0’s applications in various industrial contexts, establishing a foundation for understanding standards, IoT, and Industry 4.0 while clarifying how RAMI 4.0 is a framework for standardization. The study focuses on the impact of IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) technologies on manufacturing practices. The analysis leads to a detailed procedural framework for applying RAMI 4.0 across various industries, with an emphasis on monitoring, system design, security, digitalisation, and IoT implementation. This study proposes a guideline to standardise smart manufacturing processes and enhance the integration of RAMI 4.0 principles. The findings outline methodologies to monitor IoT systems, approaches to improve system transparency, techniques to ensure security in IoT implementation, and structured steps for system design and digitalisation. Offering a structured approach to standardization, the framework fosters a cohesive IIoT ecosystem and advances smart manufacturing practices. The methodology resolves the lack of uniformity and challenges in synthesising existing studies, improving the understanding and effectiveness of RAMI 4.0 applications across industries.},

  abstract={The construction and demolition waste management industry (CDWMI) plays a strategic role in energy conservation, emission reduction, and the development of a circular economy. Technological innovation, the cornerstone of efficient waste reduction, reuse, and recycling practices, has increasingly attracted global attention. The complexity and uncertainty of CDWMI innovation necessitate collaborative approaches. However, existing research primarily focuses on developing and applying specific technologies, overlooking macroscopic and quantitative measurements of collaborative innovation in the CDWMI. This research evaluates the overall state and dynamics of CDWMI collaborative innovation. First, we collected 1050 cooperative patents and categorized the industry development into distinct stages using technology life cycle analysis. Next, we examined the network structure of collaborative innovation through social network analysis. Finally, we revealed network characteristics and evolutionary processes across different stages from geographical, technological, and organizational dimensions. The results indicate that geographical distance has no significant impact on partnership formation, the technological focus has shifted from recycled building materials to crushing technology, and core enterprises-dominated subgroups have emerged, exhibiting an island effect. This research offers an overview of the actual state of CDWMI collaborative innovation and its underlying causes, marking an advancement over existing research. The findings can assist policymakers in formulating evidence-based strategies to promote industry development.},

  year={2024},
  volume={71},
  number={},
  pages={10534-10556},
  abstract={Maritime container shipping (MCS) firms represent the backbone of worldwide supply chains. Due to the emergence of global trends and disruptions, MCS firms increasingly face an uncertain environment. Consequently, MCS firms must develop dynamic capabilities to enable the reconfiguration of organizational resources for building resilience in a constantly changing business ecosystem. To create adequate dynamic capabilities, MCS firms need to anticipate the future of their macro environment through advanced foresight techniques. Using a Delphi-based scenario analysis, this study systematically examines scenarios for MCS firms’ macro environment. Twelve projections for the MCS industry were systematically created and were then assessed by 51 maritime experts. The resulting three distinct scenarios deliver valuable insights for MCS firms’ executives, whereas the blockchains and drones technology will have already increased efficiency in the short-term scenario “picking the low-hanging fruit,” other technological disruptions will only affect the industry in the medium-term scenario “experiencing an era of dichotomy.” In the long-term scenario “overcoming the obstacles of the generational shift,” MCS firms will experience a transfer toward alternative fuel powered and autonomously driven vessels. Offering detailed scenarios for the future MCS macro environment, this study represents a guide for decision-makers on how to create dynamic capabilities in MCS firms to build resilience. Moreover, the results revealed differences in the experts’ assessments due to their characteristics. Therefore, the study contributes to the academic focus on in-depth diversity analysis in the Delphi methodology and emphasizes the relevance of incorporating multiple stakeholders and panelists in future planning.},

  abstract={With the application of digital technologies, the business world is experiencing a disruptive revolution in terms of operations and supply chain management (OSCM). Anecdotal evidence suggests that digitalization is a viable approach for companies to achieve circular supply chain management (CSCM); however, empirical studies remain scarce. In this study, we investigate the digitalization–CSCM relationship by extracting management discussion and analysis texts from the annual reports of 1026 Chinese listed companies over 2009–2021, and measure their level of digitalization using natural language processing based on four types of technologies [i.e., artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, cloud computing and other digital technologies]. We adopt resource dependence theory as a framework to better understand the relationship between digitalization and CSCM. Firms with higher levels of digitalization perform better in CSCM. AI and cloud computing are more important than blockchain and other digital technologies in improving CSCM. Furthermore, we find that supply chain concentration negatively moderates this relationship. These findings are validated through a series of robustness checks. The study contributes to the OSCM literature by demonstrating the positive impact of digitalization on CSCM and providing an analysis of the OSCM-related moderating effects on this relationship for emerging markets.},

However, studies on the digital transition of healthcare services are still a challenge, both from a theoretical and managerial perspective. In this context, knowledge management discipline can guide the evolving environment to cover this research gap. Indeed, the digital transition is transforming how healthcare professionals access data, handle information, and manage knowledge by adopting 4.0 enabling technologies. Thus, drawing on the SECI model, this study aims to investigate the healthcare sector's technological innovation through a knowledge management perspective, and evaluate the impact of 4.0 technologies on knowledge creation processes (i.e., socialization, externalization, combination, internalization) in the healthcare domain. Finally, the article investigates the critical areas of the digital transition, and the future research directions that remain to be addressed.},

  abstract={Wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is an under-recognized cause of heart failure. Pfizer previously developed a machine learning model that performed well in identifying wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy vs. nonamyloid heart failure. However, challenges exist when introducing machine learning applications into healthcare, mainly due to restrictions on sharing patient data. This requires the triggering and execution of the model outside the developer’s infrastructure using hosts with diverse information technology capabilities. With these barriers in mind, we investigated architectural designs to facilitate the delivery of the model to the customer. We considered manageability and scalability of the model, the host’s information technology maturity, maintenance of patient data privacy, and protection of Pfizer’s intellectual property. A container-based design, wherein the application is shipped as a container image to a third-party platform, fulfilled these criteria and was piloted on a platform hosted by Philips. Objectives of this pilot included defining and testing the architectural design and technical parameters for sharing the container image, creating a scalable and modular framework to manage multiple applications on different third-party platforms, and exploring a communication pattern based on clinical decision support Hooks/Cards and representational state transfer calls within the Philips platform. Implementing the model may enable earlier identification and treatment of wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, and learnings from this pilot may lead to improved delivery of other machine learning models to healthcare providers, thereby increasing utilization. This article also presents an overview of architectural designs that may help others adopt new methodologies and ideas for machine learning model commercialization.},

  abstract={Real-time decision making is supported by data-hungry emerging technologies such as machine learning and digital twins. Innovations in manufacturing process control utilizing these technologies are constrained by interoperability. Marketing materials, sales pitches, and academic literature portray interoperability on the factory floor as seamless and robust. However, this study demonstrates that in spite of plentiful mature standards, interoperability on the factory floor is neither seamless nor robust. To exemplify interoperability in the context of an established and widely adopted standard, this study analyzes the interoperability of machine tools produced by a premier equipment builder which has exceeded US ${\$}$ 1 billion in sales with more than 200,000 machines currently in operation worldwide. Through demonstrating and discussing non-interoperability and influencing factors, this study aims to provide insights and actionable intelligence applicable to industry and academia for laymen, end users, systems integrators, standards organizations, equipment builders, and data scientists. By leveraging phronesis and empirical evidence to demonstrate the state of interoperability, this study provides a fresh perspective on an age-old manufacturing challenge.},

  pages={2255-2291},
  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology surrounded by many promises, and potentials to reshape the future of industries and society overall. A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted. The paper provides a deep insight into the technology, lists design goals and objectives, highlights design challenges and limitations across industries, discusses research and commercial developments, provides its applications and use cases, offers case studies in industry, infrastructure and healthcare, lists main service providers and stakeholders, and covers developments to date, as well as viable research dimensions for future developments in DTs.},

  title={Digital Sovereignty for Collaborative AI Engineering: A Survey}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={13},
  number={},
  pages={216438-216465},
  abstract={Collaborative AI engineering is a paradigm that enables multiple stakeholders to maintain AI pipelines by exchanging artifacts, such as data, models, and software packages. It is a cost-efficient engineering process that accelerates the development of AI applications, specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, AI artifacts are often associated with inherent intellectual property (IP) or sensitive information, which hinders collaboration due to a lack of trust among stakeholders. Digital sovereignty is viewed as an ideal state where artifact owners maintain full control over their assets, such as making key decisions regarding access, storage, and interoperability. Thus, it is postulated that implementing digital sovereignty mechanisms in multi-stakeholder information systems can address the trust gap and promote collaboration. This work addresses this gap by conducting a systematic review of the literature on digital sovereignty for collaborative AI engineering. The main contributions of this work include: i) mapping digital sovereignty definitions and requirements within the context of collaborative AI engineering, ii) identifying existing technologies and concepts for implementing sovereignty features in AI engineering, and iii) analyzing existing collaborative AI platforms such as data marketplaces, data spaces, and GAIA-X. This analysis highlights their sovereignty requirements, solutions, benefits, and implementation challenges. In addition, this work iv) identifies research gaps in data pricing, confidentiality, and interoperability, and proposes future directions to enhance digital sovereignty in collaborative AI ecosystems.},

  pages={79516-79533},
  abstract={Platform Engineering (PE) is a growing area of Software Engineering, with many facets, including the elusive concept of Internal Development Platforms (IDPs). They integrate various technologies and tools to support the realization of software projects, especially their managing and developing roles, fostering Agile collaboration and enhancing team productivity. In particular for the new trends of Agile remote working and for Agile applied to the Digital Transformation in the Public Sector. While proprietary IDPs abound, academic research that could naturally lead to open-source IDPs remain scarce. In particular for Scrum, a fundamental Agile methodology in the strategic area of Digital Transformation in the Public Sector, where IDP self-hosting is also appropriate. This paper addresses this gap by proposing the design and realization of the first, to the best of our knowledge, IDP supporting Scrum, being open-source and with self-hosting capabilities. The end-product of our research is the Compositional Agile System (CAS), an extendable microservice architecture-based IDP. Its design, as well as CAS, makes full use of hands-on previous successful experiences of IDP development by members of this team, specifically non-trivial tasks in Italian Public Administration and to foster remote working in University Software Engineering classes, a practice started during the pandemic but now a standard. We offer several architectural and example scenarios where CAS can be of use, concentrating on the Public Administration. Particularly relevant is the use of CAS in analyzing a pillar of Italian Digital Administration available to its citizens, i.e., AppIo. The software is available as an open resource to the research community.},

  abstract={Green innovation, digitization, and sustainability have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to transform organizations. This study examines the relationship between green innovation and sustainable performance and the role of green digital learning orientation and big data analytics in that relationship. Grounded in the resource-based view, this investigation analyses the direct effect of green innovation on sustainable performance, the moderating role of green digital learning orientation in that relationship, and the three-way interaction effect of green innovation, green learning orientation, and big data analytics on sustainable performance. The study collected 567 valid questionnaires from managers in manufacturing and service businesses in Iraq. The findings indicate that green innovation is positively related to sustainable performance and this relationship is stronger when green digital learning orientation is high. Additionally, the study found that big data analytics has a significant three-way interaction effect on sustainable performance. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of green innovation, green digital learning orientation, big data analytics, and sustainable performance. The contributions of this work can be valuable to startups and traditional organizations seeking to explore or seize opportunities in green innovation and digitization.},

In all test cases, the proposed method performed better than any other method, including the IoMT intrusion dataset, with an accuracy increase of 2.9%. It can also monitor IoMT networks within the healthcare and medical environment to protect IoMT devices and networks from attackers.

  pages={120709-120716},
  abstract={There is no doubt that in this hectic world, many companies seek to implement Knowledge Management (KM) as a part of their supply chain management (SCM). However, many factors affect them in many ways. As a result of this research, we will be able to find out which of these factors influenced the implementation of knowledge management in supply chain management in healthcare facilities. In order to identify the most prominent factors in this research, the Best-Worst Method (BWM) has been applied. Due to the fact that decision makers have to deal with a vague environment, DMs have to be integrated with proper methods in order to cope with this problem. The D-number is a kind of fuzzy number that is one of these methods, one of the types of fuzzy numbers. To find and prioritize the best criterion that will impact the implementation of Knowledge Management in Supply Chain Management with the Best-Worst Method, we conducted this research. This model of decision-making attempts to eliminate the pitfall of Analytical Hierarchy Process by using a Multi-Attribute Decision-Making strategy. Using multi-criteria decision-making in uncertain environments, this paper reviews the literature on knowledge management applied to Supply Chain Management (SCM). These methods have not been implemented in the healthcare industry in previous studies, both theoretically and methodologically. Based on the results of the study, it should be noted that, among the 12 criteria, two of them have been eliminated with the use of the Delphi method; culture capacity is the most important criterion and should be targeted by healthcare facilities companies. In order to implement KM in SCM to facilitate the healthcare system, these companies would need to focus on the culture capability factor in order to implement KM in SCM successfully.},

This approach aims to identify critical areas of concern, determine short- and long-term mitigation measures for each identified critical area for establishing stability and interpretive mechanisms through digital technologies, and propose practical solutions for establishing resilient supply chains through a robust supply chain framework.

  abstract={The proposed address resolution protocol (CPI-ARP) is designed for the cyber-physical Internet (CPI) environment, integrating physical and digital logistics networks. By extending traditional ARP mechanisms, CPI-ARP addresses the practical requirement for coordinated asset tracking and state awareness of vehicles and physical shipment units (PSUs) within global logistics systems. The protocol enables coordinated interaction between digital and physical operations by linking logical network addresses (PIP) with physical addresses (PMAC) and physical locations. Key challenges related to synchronizing network and physical address systems, including scalability, mobility, and real-time data synchronization, are addressed in this protocol. Performance evaluations through simulation experiments under various network conditions demonstrate CPI-ARP’s ability to reduce latency, improve packet delivery, and support logistics system responsiveness in intracity and cross-border contexts. These findings pave the way for further development and standardization of CPI networks, contributing to the optimization of global logistics operations.},

  year={2025},
  volume={71},
  number={3},
  pages={681-695},
  abstract={The integration of 5G Multicast Broadcast Services (5MBS) within 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-based Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) represents a major advancement in bridging the digital divide and improving network efficiency for multicast and broadcast communication. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the integration of 5MBS over NTN, focusing on a simulation-based performance evaluation. NTN, including Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems, offer extensive coverage capabilities, particularly benefiting rural and underserved areas. A key highlight is the incorporation of Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)-based Time Interleaving (TIL) mechanisms, which enhance broadcast resilience in NTN environments. NTN channels are characterized by high user mobility and dynamic channel conditions. By leveraging time diversity and spreading coded bits across non-consecutive slots, the proposed approach mitigates the effects of fast-fading and Doppler shift scenarios, achieving performance gains from 1 dB at lower speeds to 2.8 dB at 500 km/h, ensuring robust communication under Line of Sight (LoS) and Non Line of Sight (NLoS) conditions. This study proposes a 5MBS solution tailored for NTN deployment using a Link Level Simulator (LLS), considering channel modeling, environmental factors, and high mobility scenarios. The results show that while existing NTN setups struggle to maintain performance in high-speed environments (e.g., airplanes), the proposed HARQ-based TIL significantly improves performance under these challenging conditions. These findings validate the feasibility of integrating 5MBS with NTN and highlight its potential to deliver scalable and reliable broadcast and multicast services. The study provides valuable insights for future enhancements in 5G-Advanced systems and lays the foundation for novel Terrestrial Networks (TN)-NTN convergent deployments, contributing to the evolution of satellite-based communication networks and the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT)-2030 evaluation process.},

  abstract={Digital transformation provides an unprecedented opportunity for the exploration, integration, and utilization of scientific and technological resources (STR). In the wave of digital transformation, countries around the world have set up their own STR sharing platforms, which can match a variety of STR services and needs in a lower cost and more convenient way, and create interaction between the suppliers and demanders. These sharing platforms provide possibilities to realize the sharing economy in the field of scientific and technological innovation. However, it is also necessary to design the corresponding mechanisms to improve the sharing rate and sharing value. Therefore, in this article, we construct a new framework of operation mechanism for China's STR allocation system and design its three submechanisms. Then, a system dynamics model of the operation mechanism is designed, and the experiments are carried out. The simulation results show that the mechanism proposed in this article can effectively improve the sharing rate and sharing value. Finally, some policy suggestions are put forward, which will help the government to improve management mode and optimize resource allocation.},

  abstract={In recent years, mobile health applications (mHealth apps) have created a new social context in the clinical diagnosis process based on technology innovation. To improve understanding of digital transformation in healthcare and determinants for its implementation, this article examines the available mHealth apps addressed to medical practitioners and explores these apps features’ trustworthiness, quality, and popularity. Based on the normalization process theory, we explain the process from the introduction of mHealth innovation in the clinical practice to the intention of professional engagement. We conduct content analysis of the apps’ descriptions, functions, and user reviews; measured available app features and performance metrics; and applied statistical analysis to understand features intercorrelations and users’ preferences. We observe moderate levels of reliability and quality in the existing mHealth apps, revealing margins for potential improvement. The mHealth app star rating, quality score, and downloads are all highly intercorrelated. The apps with more features score higher in quality, especially those with credible sources, feedback opportunities, and “how to use” instructions. App development from credible sources can increase their trustworthiness. Further, technological advances in these apps can greatly benefit health professionals’ everyday practice and, thus, healthcare for society. This article contributes to the information systems research by using social theories to reveal the importance of app features to the adoption of professional health applications and underline the sets of policies/practices that should apply in the app development process to strengthen clinical efficiency and effectiveness.},

  year={2023},
  volume={31},
  number={6},
  pages={2698-2713},
  abstract={Network slicing is a key capability for next generation mobile networks. It enables infrastructure providers to cost effectively customize logical networks over a shared infrastructure. A critical component of network slicing is resource allocation, which needs to ensure that slices receive the resources needed to support their services while optimizing network efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to slice-based resource allocation named Guaranteed seRvice Efficient nETwork slicing (GREET). The underlying concept is to set up a constrained resource allocation game, where ( $i$ ) slices unilaterally optimize their allocations to best meet their (dynamic) customer loads, while ( $ii$ ) constraints are imposed to guarantee that, if they wish so, slices receive a pre-agreed share of the network resources. The resulting game is a variation of the well-known Fisher market, where slices are provided a budget to contend for network resources (as in a traditional Fisher market), but (unlike a Fisher market) prices are constrained for some resources to ensure that the pre-agreed guarantees are met for each slice. In this way, GREET combines the advantages of a share-based approach (high efficiency by flexible sharing) and reservation-based ones (which provide guarantees by assigning a fixed amount of resources). We characterize the Nash equilibrium, best response dynamics, and propose a practical slice strategy with provable convergence properties. Extensive simulations exhibit substantial improvements over network slicing state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

Health-5G is based on scenarios in which emergency personnel wear mixed reality glasses that can transmit audio, video, and data streams bidirectionally over a 5G network to medical specialists stationed in a hospital at any distance. Thanks to Health-5G, the specialist will be able to access the emergency team’s point of view at any time and provide verbal and visual instructions, including gestures and positioning of graphical markers in 3D space. In this way, emergency personnel can provide the best possible care to the patient without having to wait for them to arrive at the hospital, saving a lot of time in scenarios where every second can make a difference. Health-5G also addresses the integration of medical devices and the collection of the patient’s medical data in a scalable way through optical character recognition. A case study is discussed where Health-5G is used to attend a patient in the street suffering from syncope due to third-degree atrioventricular block. Latency and performance tests over a 5G network are also discussed. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive solution in the literature that provides all the capabilities offered by Health-5G in terms of functionality and advanced interaction mechanisms within the context of remote, immersive support in emergency situations.},

  abstract={The recent Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) specifications promote the evolution of RAN architecture by function disaggregation, adoption of open interfaces, and instantiation of a hierarchical closed-loop control architecture managed by RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) entities. This paves the road to novel data-driven network management approaches based on programmable logic. Aided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), novel solutions targeting traditionally unsolved RAN management issues can be devised. Nevertheless, the adoption of such smart and autonomous systems is limited by the current inability of human operators to understand the decision process of such AI/ML solutions, affecting their trust in such novel tools. eXplainable AI (XAI) aims at solving this issue, enabling human users to better understand and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent schemes, reducing the human-to-machine barrier. In this survey, we provide a summary of the XAI methods and metrics before studying their deployment over the O-RAN Alliance RAN architecture along with its main building blocks. We then present various use-cases and discuss the automation of XAI pipelines for O-RAN as well as the underlying security aspects. We also review some projects/standards that tackle this area. Finally, we identify different challenges and research directions that may arise from the heavy adoption of AI/ML decision entities in this context, focusing on how XAI can help to interpret, understand, and improve trust in O-RAN operational networks.},

  abstract={Next-generation mobile networks will rely on their autonomous operation. Virtual Network Functions empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can adapt to varying environments that encompass both network conditions and the cloud platform executing them. In this view, it becomes paramount to understand why AI/ML algorithms made a decision, to be able to reason upon those decisions and, eventually, take further decisions related to e.g., network orchestration. In this paper, we present ATHENA, an ML-based radio resource scheduler for virtualized Radio Access Network (RAN) system. Our real-software implementation shows that the proposed ML-based approach can outperform the baseline solution. We discuss how additional re-orchestration actions can be taken by analyzing our scheduling decisions and learning from the past.},

  abstract={Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) has emerged as a leading Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) solution for enabling connectivity in Internet of Things (IoT) wireless networks. The network slicing paradigm facilitates multitenancy and allows heterogeneous applications with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements to coexist in various IoT use cases. This article addresses the radio resource allocation problem in a multitenant LoRaWAN network, where each tenant may serve multiple applications supported by Network Slicing (NS). To this end, we propose an optimization model to determine the optimal channel and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation for each end device in a multioperator environment with heterogeneous applications. The model maximizes aggregated normalized throughput while ensuring fairness among Network Operators (NOs), employing linearization strategies to solve the problem efficiently. Our evaluation demonstrates the maximum achievable LoRaWAN network capacity to accommodate diverse IoT smart city applications from different tenants. The results confirm that optimal resource allocations can be achieved within reasonable time frames while meeting all requirements, including fair resource distribution among slices, compliance with regulatory constraints, such as duty cycle limitations, assurance of QoS metrics (throughput, delay, and packet delivery ratio) for each NO, and full isolation of resources allocated to different NOs.},

  abstract={This article derives and validates a set of distance conversion factors for the magnetic field emissions limits in the frequency range from 9 kHz to 30 MHz, which are intended to be proposed for their inclusion in new electromagnetic compatibility standards. Simulation models based on loop-type electromagnetic field sources are employed to evaluate, using the method of moments, the changes in the amplitude of the H-field components along the measurement axes. An algorithm is developed to extract the H-field strengths normalized to the reference distance and then, through methods for optimal detection of changepoints, such a normalized curve is fitted to a piece-wise linear function that becomes the generalized distance conversion factor, presented in the form of simplified equations. The fitness of the model is checked through experiments carried out in representative locations, showing a very good agreement between measurement and simulations. The adequacy of the conversion factors and the problem around the equipment under test are also analyzed.},

  abstract={Open Process Automation (OPA) and Digital Twin (DT) technologies show great promise to reduce risk, downtime, and energy consumption, while improving safety and efficiency in manufacturing systems. OPA defines a reference architecture for the construction of scalable, reliable, interoperable, and secure automation systems with products from multiple vendors as a single, cohesive system. DTs are purpose-driven dynamic digital replicas of physical assets, processes, systems, or products. Both technologies enable increased options and competition for accelerating future innovation. However, there are significant challenges to adopting these technologies, including “plug-and-play” interoperability, access to data, access to equipment, and the combination of different DTs for system-wide improvements. This paper demonstrates and evaluates a DT Framework solution for performance monitoring in process manufacturing systems that aims to avoid unplanned downtime, a prevalent challenge that pressures profitability in manufacturing. The DT framework is built and demonstrated through an OPA testbed system that allows seamless gathering and analyzing of data from a process manufacturing line. The proposed DT framework solution provides guidelines to develop, test, and evaluate new system-wide DT solutions without interrupting production operations and without costly R&D investments.},

  abstract={Despite the touting value of blockchain technology (BT), many agri-food supply chains are still struggling to the adoption of it. In this article, incorporating the benefit and cost associated with BT, we seek to answer whether and under what conditions can two competing agri-food supply chains benefit from the adoption of BT, and how government choose optimal subsidy scheme to promote the adoption of BT. The findings suggest that the Nash equilibrium outcome toward BT adoption strategy will be greatly affected by key parameters, such as competitive intensity, the growth rate of the market size and the investment cost with the adoption of BT, and the planting cost of the agri-food. Specifically, early adopter can always snatch more benefit from the adoption of the BT than the follower, and the gap between them will be increased in the competition intensity. In addition, the decisions selected by agri-food supply chains does not always benefit the consumer surplus and the social welfare, which call for further government subsidy scheme to promote the adoption of BT. The findings provide important implications for both the industrial managers and policy makers on how to benefit from BT in the digital transformation era.},

  title={Developing the Innovation Capabilities of SMEs: The Role of Intermediary Firms in Knowledge Ecosystems}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={72},
  number={},
  pages={604-618},
  abstract={Knowledge ecosystems drive growth by enabling firms to access diverse, specialized, and distributed resources from ecosystem members, allowing them to address complex product innovation challenges that would be difficult to tackle independently. This approach facilitates complementary value creation. However, small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) encounter significant challenges within such ecosystems due to their limited size and limited resources. This article contributes to the extant studies on knowledge ecosystems by investigating how collaborations within these ecosystems enable SMEs to both explore and exploit knowledge, enhancing their innovation capabilities. Drawing on empirical data from 33 semistructured interviews and two focus groups involving multiple stakeholders (18 SMEs, 1 large firm, and 14 intermediary firms) from a knowledge ecosystem in Ostrobothnia, Finland, this article finds that knowledge cocreation through collaboration significantly improves SMEs’ technological and collaborative capabilities, leading to growth and market expansion. Intermediary firms play a dual role, going beyond knowledge brokering by providing capacity-building support that helps SMEs better contextualize and utilize external knowledge. This article advances both theoretical and practical understanding by demonstrating how intermediary firms function not only as facilitators but also as active capacity builders in the knowledge exploitation process. This nuanced understanding contributes to the ongoing discourse on ecosystem dynamics and SME innovation. From a practical perspective, SMEs should leverage core partners and intermediaries to address their inherent resource constraints and drive innovation performance. This approach enables them to expand their networks, codevelop technological solutions, and potentially secure future funding.},

  year={2025},
  volume={29},
  number={10},
  pages={7657-7667},
  abstract={Clinical predictive analysis is a crucial task with numerous applications and has been extensively studied using machine learning approaches. Clinical notes, a vital data source, have been employed to develop natural language processing (NLP) models for risk prediction in healthcare with robust performance. However, clinical notes vary considerably in text composition–written by diverse healthcare providers for different purposes–and the impact of these variations on NLP modeling is also underexplored. It also remains uncertain whether the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) with instruction-following capabilities can effectively handle the risk prediction task out-of-the-box, especially when using routinely collected clinical notes instead of polished text. We address these two important research questions in the context of in-hospital mortality prediction within the critical care setting. Specifically, we propose a supervised hierarchical network with note-specific modules to account for variations across different note categories, and provide a detailed comparison with strong supervised baselines and LLMs. We benchmark 34 instruction-following LLMs based on zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting with diverse prompt templates. Our results demonstrate that the note-specific network delivers improved risk prediction performance compared to established supervised baselines from both measurement-based and text-based modeling. In contrast, LLMs consistently underperform on this critical task, despite their remarkable performances in other domains. This highlights important limitations and raises caution regarding the use of LLMs for risk assessment in the critical setting. Additionally, we show that the proposed model can be leveraged to select informative clinical notes to enhance the training of other models.},

  abstract={The price gouging or price hike is a worldwide issue, and it is related to inflation. Because of rising prices, people in various countries cannot afford nutritious food or proper treatment. Sometimes shops, restaurants, and transportation service providers charge more than the prescribed product price from buyers. In addition, unauthorized VAT or Tax is taken on products that the government exempts. Another reason for price hikes is bribery, and it occurs in transporting and delivering goods. This article introduces a blockchain-based Internet of Things model to monitor product price hikes and corruption from the Industry 4.0 and blockchain 5.0 point of view. Industries produce and package different products. Wholesalers and retailers purchase products from industrial companies. The primary goal of this article is to propose a blockchain mechanism for monitoring price hikes and corruption where the government can monitor buying and selling between buyers and industrial companies. Here, we have established blockchain-integrated remote database model where blockchain relates to a relational database management system that uses remote database access protocol and Cloud server. This article presents the brief evolution of blockchain and industry generations. Finally, this article provides a next generation blockchain model. An intelligent government connected with Industry 4.0 monitors price hikes and corruption.},

  abstract={Vast sums of public money are invested into universities globally as anchor institutions and knowledge bases providing seedbed resources for research and development and entrepreneurship. Focusing on university science and technology research we examine two U.K. case studies of government support from the “Innovation Knowledge Centre” (IKC) program to translate research into industry innovation for public good. Although IKCs are not tasked to address climate change, the two case studies demonstrate tremendous potential for Cleantech development. An exploratory entrepreneurial finance (“entfin”) ecosystem theoretical lens contextualizes the catalytic roles of universities and public funding to support industry at the base of the innovation finance escalator. We thus develop university-industry ecosystems literature, addressing the gap in nurturing university entfin for climate change. Our qualitative case study methodology includes literature review and 51 key informant interviews with: policymakers; university research leaders, technology transfer officers, specialist research to industry innovation “translation” staff, SME beneficiaries, trade bodies; and early-stage private finance providers. We reveal nuances in different emerging innovation sectors—notably their degree of maturity, locality, and outcome horizons for achieving impact, drawing attention to the key roles of universities and financing and their interactions within their entfin ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for government long horizon, deep pocket, investment, and integrated university entfin policy mix, alongside more open, inclusive, ecosystem development between different actors.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming popular due to their use in many commercial and military applications, and their affordability. The UAVs are equipped with various sensors, hardware platforms and software technologies which enable them to support the diverse application portfolio. Sensors include vision-based sensors such as RGB-D cameras, thermal cameras, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), mmWave radars, ultrasonic sensors, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) which enable UAVs for autonomous navigation, obstacle detection, collision avoidance, object tracking and aerial inspection. To enable smooth operation, UAVs utilize a number of communication technologies such as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), long range (LoRa), long-term evolution for machine-type communication (LTE-M), etc., along with various machine learning algorithms. However, each of these different technologies come with their own set of advantages and challenges. Hence, it is essential to have an overview of the different type of sensors, computing and communication modules and algorithms used for UAVs. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art embedded sensors, communication technologies, computing platforms and machine learning techniques used in autonomous UAVs. The key performance metrics along with operating principles and a detailed comparative study of the various technologies are also studied and presented. The information gathered in this paper aims to serve as a practical reference guide for designing smart sensing applications, low-latency and energy efficient communication strategies, power efficient computing modules and machine learning algorithms for autonomous UAVs.

We examine many current and emerging LPWAN technologies, as well as their system architectures and standards, and evaluate their ability to meet each design objective. In addition, the possible coexistence of LPWAN with other technologies, combining the best attributes to provide an optimum solution is also explored and reported in the current overview. Following that, a comparison of various LPWAN technologies is performed and their market opportunities are also investigated. Furthermore, an analysis of various LPWAN use cases is performed, highlighting their benefits and drawbacks. This aids in the selection of the best LPWAN technology for various applications.

  abstract={In this paper, we present a novel multiclass-target classification method for mmWave frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar operating in the frequency range of 77 - 81 GHz, based on custom range-angle heatmaps and machine learning tools. The elevation field of view (FoV) is increased by orienting the Radar antennas in elevation. In this orientation, the radar focuses the beam in elevation to improve the elevation FoV. The azimuth FoV is improved by mechanically rotating the Radar horizontally, which has antenna elements oriented in the elevation direction. The data from the Radar measurements obtained by mechanical rotation of the Radar in Azimuth are used to generate a range-angle heatmap. The measurements are taken in a variety of real-world scenarios with various objects such as humans, a car, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), also known as a drone. The proposed technique achieves accuracy of 97.6 % and 99.6 % for classifying the UAV and humans, respectively, and accuracy of 98.1 % for classifying the car from the range-angle FoV heatmap. Such a Radar classification technique will be extremely useful for a wide range of applications in cost-effective and dependable autonomous systems, including ground station traffic monitoring and surveillance, as well as control systems for both on-ground and aerial vehicles.},

  abstract={In this article, we present a novel localization and activity classification method for aerial vehicle using mmWave frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) Radar. The localization and activity classification for aerial vehicle enables the utilization of mmWave Radars in security surveillance and privacy monitoring applications. In the proposed method, Radar's antennas are oriented vertically to measure the elevation angle of arrival of the aerial vehicle from ground station. The height of the aerial vehicle and horizontal distance of the aerial vehicle from Radar station on ground are estimated using the measured radial range and the elevation angle of arrival. The aerial vehicle's activity is classified using machine learning methods on micro-Doppler signatures extracted from Radar measurements taken in an outdoor environment. To evaluate performance, various light weight classification models such as logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), Light gradient boosting machine (GBM), and a custom lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) are investigated. Based on the results, the logistic regression, SVM, and Light GBM achieve an accuracy of 93%. Furthermore, the custom lightweight CNN can achieve activity classification accuracy of 95%. The performance of the proposed lightweight CNN is also compared with the pre-trained models (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, and InceptionResNet). The proposed lightweight CNN suits best for embedded and/or edge computing devices.},

Thermal images are more resistant to environmental changes than red–green–blue (RGB) images for hand gesture recognition. However, one disadvantage of using thermal images for the aforementioned task is the scarcity of labeled thermal datasets. To tackle this problem, we propose a method that combines unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques with deep-learning (DL) technology to remove the need for labeled data in the learning process. There are several types and methods for implementing UDA, with adversarial UDA being one of the most common. In this article, the first time in this field, we propose a novel adversarial UDA model that uses channel attention and bottleneck layers to learn domain-invariant features across RGB and thermal domains. Thus, the proposed model leverages the information from the labeled RGB data to solve the hand gesture recognition task using thermal images. We evaluate the proposed model on two hand gesture datasets, namely, Sign Digit Classification and Alphabet Gesture Classification, and compare it to other benchmark models in terms of accuracy, model size, and model parameters. Our model outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods on the Sign Digit Classification and Alphabet Gesture Classification datasets and achieves 91.32% and 80.91% target test accuracy, respectively.},

  abstract={Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attained considerable attention for providing reliable and cost-effective communication due to the flexibility of deployment and line of sight (LoS) propagation. Efficient UAV path planning is one of the key aspects that need to be addressed to minimize energy consumption and satisfy the rate requirements of the user. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes the modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for UAV path planning to support the rate requirements of the user. In the proposed framework, the problem of joint path planning and energy consumption is formulated to improve the instantaneous sum rate of the user. In order to solve the formulation, the proposed framework involves two steps. Initially, the line of sight probability is used to obtain an optimal destination location at which the UAV is in LoS with the user and offers the required downlink rate. Following that, the modified PSO is used to find the most energy-efficient path from the source to the destination. Through experiments, we show that the proposed framework provides a three-dimensional (3D) path in a complex environment, and has the ability to avoid obstacles in the path. In addition, it minimizes energy consumption and travel time and improves the user rate as compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is tested in three different scenarios and shows that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in all scenarios.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) classification and identification have many applications in a variety of fields, including UAV tracking systems, antidrone systems, intrusion detection systems, military, space research, product delivery, agriculture, search and rescue, and internet carrier. It is challenging to identify a specific drone and/or type in critical scenarios, such as intrusion. In this article, a UAV classification method that utilizes fixed boundary empirical wavelet sub-bands of radio frequency (RF) fingerprints and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. In the proposed method, RF fingerprints collected from UAV receivers are decomposed into 16 fixed boundary empirical wavelet sub-band signals. Then, these sub-band signals are then fed into a lightweight deep CNN model to classify various types of UAVs. Using the proposed method, we classify a total of 15 different commercially available UAVs with an average testing accuracy of 97.25%. The proposed model is also tested with various sampling points in the signal. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared with recently reported works for classifying UAVs utilizing remote controller RF signals.},

  abstract={Small form factor radar sensors at millimeter wavelengths find numerous applications in the industrial and automotive sectors. These radar sensors provide improved range resolution, good angular resolution, and enhanced Doppler resolution for short range and ultrashort ranges. However, it is challenging to detect and track the targets accurately when a radar is interfered by another radar. This article proposes an experimental evaluation of a 77-GHz IWR1642 radar sensor in the presence of a second 77-GHz AWR1642 radar sensor acting as a spot jammer. A real-time experiment is carried out by considering five different targets of various cross sections, such as a car, a larger size motorcycle, a smaller size motorcycle, a cyclist, and a pedestrian. The collected real-time data are processed by four different constant false alarm rate detectors, cell averaging (CA)-CFAR, ordered statistics (OS)-CFAR, greatest of CA (GOCA)-CFAR, and smallest of CA (SOCA)-CFAR. Following that, data from these detectors are fed into two different clustering algorithms (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and K-means), followed by the extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based tracker with global nearest neighbor (GNN) data association, which provide tracks of various targets with and without the presence of a jammer. Furthermore, four different metrics [tracks reported (TR), track segments (TSs), false tracks (FTs), and track loss (TL)] are used to evaluate the performance of various tracks generated for two clustering algorithms with four detection schemes. The experimental results show that the DBSCAN clustering algorithm outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm for many cases.},

  abstract={In complex networks, node impact refers to an individual node’s significance or influence within the structure. The evaluation of the impact of the nodes in information transmission, prevention of pandemics, and resilience applications of the infrastructure is studied. Centrality measures are crucial for understanding the impact of particular nodes in the network structure. Most centrality measures, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality, provide influential node information based on network aspects such as connection patterns, paths for communication, and influence propagation dynamics. However, these centrality measures could capture local and global information by balancing time complexity and spreading efficiency. This paper proposes an Isolating-Betweenness Centrality (ISBC) for quantifying node impact by incorporating the properties Betweenness Centrality and Isolating Centrality. The proposed measure evaluates a node’s impact by considering local and global structural influence. We verify the SIR and IC epidemic models to evaluate ISBC’s performance compared with conventional and recent centrality measures on real-world datasets. Furthermore, we show that the proposed measure exhibits improved spreading efficiency over recent and conventional measures with moderate time complexity.},

  pages={1951-1966},
  abstract={The lifetime of a UAV-assisted wireless network is determined by the amount of energy consumed by the UAVs during flight, data collection, and transmission to the ground station. Routing protocols are commonly used for data transmission in a communication network. However, because of the mobility of UAVs, using a routing protocol with a single communication technology results in higher delay and more energy consumption in a UAV-assisted wireless network. To overcome this, we propose two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, Q-learning and deep Q-network (DQN), for energy-efficient data transmission over a hybrid BLE/LTE/Wi-Fi/LoRa UAV-assisted wireless network. We consider BLE, LTE, Wi-Fi, and LoRa for communication over a UAV-GS link. The RL algorithms take any random network as input and learn the best policy to output the network with less energy consumption. The reward/penalty is chosen in such a way that the network with the highest energy consumption is penalized and the one with the lowest is rewarded, thereby minimizing total network energy consumption. Based on learning, it creates a hybrid BLE/LTE/Wi-Fi/LoRa UAV-assisted wireless network by assigning the best communication technology to a UAV-GS link. Further, we compare the performance of proposed RL algorithms with a rule-based algorithm and random hybrid scheme. In addition, we propose a theoretical framework for constructing hybrid network for both free space and free space multipath path loss models. We demonstrate the performance comparison of the proposed work with the conventional shortest path routing algorithm in terms of network energy consumption and average network delay using extensive results. Finally, the effect of the velocity of the UAV and the number of packets on the performance of the proposed framework is analyzed.},

  abstract={The detection and ranking of influential nodes in complex networks are crucial for various practical applications such as identifying potential drug targets in protein-to-protein interaction networks, critical devices in communication networks, key people in social networks, and transportation hubs in logistics networks. The knowledge of influential spreaders in complex networks is extremely useful for controlling the spread of information. Centrality measures are known for effectively quantifying the influential nodes information in large-scale complex networks. Researchers have proposed different centrality measures in the literature, including Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, and Clustering coefficient centralities. However, these measures have certain limitations when implemented over large-scale complex networks. Most of these measures can be classified as global and local structural approaches. The global structure based algorithms are too complex to evaluate key nodes, particularly in large-scale networks, whereas the local measures overlook the essential global network information. To address these challenges, an extended clustering coefficient local global centrality (ECLGC) is proposed, which combines the local and global structural information to measure the node’s influence in large-scale networks. The effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed measure are compared with existing centrality measures on real-world network datasets. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is utilized to evaluate the performance of the ECLGC to capture the high-information dissemination compared to conventional measures. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed measure outperforms the conventional measures in terms of spreading efficiency.},

  pages={48404-48419},
  abstract={Ranking influential nodes within complex networks offers invaluable insights into a wide array of phenomena ranging from disease management to information dissemination and optimal routing in real-time networking applications. Centrality measures, which quantify the importance of nodes based on network properties and relationships of nodes within the network, are instrumental in achieving this task. These measures are typically classified into local and global centralities. Global measures consider the overall structure and connectivity patterns. However, they often suffer from high computational complexity in large-scale networks. On the other hand, local measures focus on the immediate neighborhood of each node, potentially overlooking global information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric called Isolating Clustering Centrality (ISCL), which leverages a convex combination approach. By introducing a convex tuning parameter, ISCL enhances the applicability and adaptability of centrality measures across a wide range of real-world network applications. In this study, we assess the efficacy of the proposed measure using real-world network datasets and simulate the spreading process using susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) and independent cascade (IC) models. Our extensive results demonstrate that ISCL significantly improves spreading efficiency compared to conventional and recent centrality measures, while also maintaining better computational efficiency in large-scale complex networks.},

  abstract={It is still challenging to accurately localize unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from a ground control station (GCS) using various sensors. The mmWave frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars offer excellent performance for target detection and localization in harsh environments and low lighting conditions. However, the estimated angle of arrival (AoA) of targets in the captured scene is quite poor. This article focuses on improving AoA estimation by combining the cutting-edge machine learning (ML) algorithms with a mechanical radar rotor setup. An mmWave FMCW radar system is mounted on a programmable rotor to capture range–angle maps of targets at various locations. The range–angle images are then labeled and trained further with the Yolov3 algorithm. Subsequent testing reveals that for detected target objects, the centroid of the bounding boxes from the detected objects provides accurate AoA estimation with very low root mean square error (RMSE). The results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of performance and estimation accuracy.},

  abstract={Rapid advancements in communication technologies in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain have had an impact on the application of positioning technology across multiple domains. Although there have been numerous fully fledged approaches for detection and localization in outdoor scenarios, due to high path loss and shadowing, these are insufficiently accurate in indoor scenarios. The primary enabler of various healthcare and safety applications is the precise sensing and localization of targets. A cost-effective approach with little maintenance is crucial for the development of such reliable systems. To address such sensing and localization challenges in indoor scenarios, we propose a novel dynamic target detection technique based on an ensembled convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier. An AWR1843 Radar sensor is used to collect data corresponding to dynamic targets in indoor scenarios. The range of each moving target in the room is estimated using point cloud data extracted from the received signal. An ensemble-based 1-D CNN classifier is used to analyze the data. To model the ensemble classifier, we used three CNN classifiers. The performances of the state-of-the-art classifiers considered in the comparison varied between 44$\%$ and 95$\%$ in terms of accuracy. In contrast, the proposed system attained an accuracy of 97.65$\%$ during training and 96.47$\%$ during testing and outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Maximizing the energy efficiency of this UAV infrastructure is important. Motivated by this, we propose joint resource allocation and UAV scheduling with GRS sleeping (GRSS). Further, we propose the use of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) with joint transmission (JT) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) along with GRSS to increase the coverage and data rates, respectively. Through exhaustive simulation results, we show that the proposed CoMP along with GRSS results in up to 10% higher energy savings and 24% increase in coverage. Further, NOMA along with GRSS results in up to 9% enhancement in throughput of the system.},

  abstract={Identifying influential nodes within complex networks holds significant importance for enhancing network resilience and understanding vulnerabilities, thereby providing insights for both theoretical exploration and practical applications. Understanding how quickly information spreads highlights the need to identify influential nodes promptly. Certain global centrality measures, including betweenness (BC), closeness (CC), eigenvector (EC), katz centrality, and coreness score (CR), fail to recognize influential nodes situated near the periphery of the network and those with direct connections to the target node. In response to these challenges and to enhance the influence of identification, we have developed a comprehensive framework, namely IS $\mathbb {C}$ , grounded in isolating coefficient, encompassing both a node’s direct connections and those of its neighbors. Using the proposed approach, we defined six new centrality measures, including isolating katz centrality (ISKC), isolating coreness centrality (ISCR), isolating eigenvector centrality (ISEC), isolating betweenness centrality (ISBC), isolating closeness centrality (ISCC), and isolating clustering coefficient centrality (ISCL). Through comparative analysis across five real-world networks, IS $\mathbb {C}$  is evaluated alongside existing centrality measures, confirming its effectiveness in identifying influential nodes while maintaining reasonable computational efficiency. The experimental results affirm that IS $\mathbb {C}$  outperforms other centrality measures in locating influential nodes within complex networks. Additionally, we evaluate the similarity between our proposed methods and both conventional and recent measures by assessing rank correlations using Kendall’s tau coefficient. The simulation outcomes indicate that one of the proposed methods ISCR, utilizing a lower-complexity algorithm, effectively identifies the most influential nodes with high accuracy. Furthermore, statistical techniques were employed to evaluate the proposed methods, demonstrating high reliability and precision in predicting influential nodes across various datasets, as indicated by low standard deviations and narrow confidence intervals.},

  abstract={Modern organizations are process-oriented. To remain competitive in the digital transformation era, these organizations design and implement Information Systems (IS) to support their business processes. The emergence of the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) style made it possible to design IS architectural models that meet software quality criteria and are aligned with the organizations’ business models. However, designing such SOA services is a complex task that requires extensive knowledge and skills in software architecture and the business domain. Researchers and practitioners have proposed several methods to derive SOA services from business models during the last two decades. However, SOA design initiatives from business models still fail. Existing methods and processes to design process-aware IS have limitations related to their usability and implementation complexity. These limitations triggered the necessity for a survey that extracts more information about how to design SOA architectural models from business models. This work proposes a systematic literature review (SLR) to establish the state of the knowledge about the existing methods that derive service models from business models. This SLR provides practitioners, such as solutions architects, business architects, and application architects, a comprehensive overview of available methods to derive SOA architectural models from business models, helping them design SOA services and build effective software solutions. We selected forty-one primary studies published between 2006 and 2023. We compared selected methods according to seven specific criteria, namely: design life cycle coverage, detailed specification support, SoaML support, service granularity, the use of patterns, automation, and tool support. The results confirm that SOA is an established architectural style for building effective ISs that support organizations’ business processes. As far as we observed from comparing selected methods according to the selected criteria, our findings explain the need for a new method that provides organizations with an easy-to-use and comprehensive process to derive quality SOA models from business models.},

  abstract={Technological advancement is redefining supply chains (SCs) processes and soon traditional ways of managing SCs will no more be feasible and effective. Due to recent advancement in technology, digitalization has become an emerging topic among decision-makers and researchers. To cope-up with this emerging trend in customer behavior and remain competitive, organizations must move from their traditional ways of managing their SCs to digital supply chains (DSCs) for improved organizational performance. Therefore, the purpose of this article is in two folds: First, to identify critical factors of DSCs that are essential for transitioning traditional SCs to DSCs to improve organizational performance. Second, interpretive structural modeling is used to establish the relationship among critical factors and (matriced’ impacts croise´s multiplication applique´e a´un classement used to identify the driving and dependency power of the critical factors. Thus, this article identified fifteen DSC critical factors and established their direct and indirect effect on DSCs.

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has been envisioned as an enabler of the digital transformation that can enhance different features of people’s daily lives, such as healthcare, home automation, and smart transportation. The vast amount of data generated by a massive number of devices in an IoT system could lead to a severe performance problem. Edge cloud computing and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies are potential approaches to improve the efficiency of resource use and the flexibility of responsive services in an IoT system. In this paper, we consider the joint optimization problem of gateway placement and multihop routing in the IoT layer, the problem of service placement in the edge and cloud layers of an NFV-enabled IoT system in edge cloud computing (NIoT). We propose three optimization models (i.e., GMO, SP1O, SP2O) that allow an IoT service provider to find the optimal deployment of gateways, the optimal resource allocation for service functions, and the optimal routing according to a cost function with a performance constraint in a NIoT system. We then develop three approximation algorithms (i.e., GMA, SP1A, SP2A) for tackling the problems in a large-scale NIoT system. The evaluation results under a set of scenarios with various topologies and parameters show that the approximation algorithms can obtain results close to the optimal solution with a significant reduction in computation time. We also derive new insights into the strategy for an IoT provider to optimize its objectives. Specifically, the results suggest that an IoT provider should select an appropriate service placement strategy with regard to a charging agreement with an NFV infrastructure provider, and only deploy service functions with a strict delay requirement on the edge of networks for optimizing its cost.},

  abstract={A new generation of open and disaggregated Radio Access Networks (RANs) enabling multi-vendor, flexible, and cost-effective deployments is being promoted by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance. However, this new level of disaggregation in the RAN also entails new security risks that must be carefully addressed. The O-RAN Alliance has established Working Group 11 (WG11) to ensure that the new specifications are secure by design. Acknowledging the new security challenges arising from the expanded threat surface, O-RAN WG11 provides procedures to identify threats and assess and mitigate risks. Reportedly, as of 2024, 60% of found risks are related to Denial of Service (DoS) and performance degradation. Therefore, in this work, we analyse a vanilla O-RAN deployment and evaluate the endurance of different O-RAN interfaces under attacks in scenarios involving DoS and performance degradation. To do so, we use a reference O-RAN open source deployment to report, risks found, weak points, and counter-intuitive recommended design choices for both control plane (A1, E2, and F1-c) and user plane (F1-u) interfaces. Consequently, we map O-RAN WG11’s threat model and risk assessment methodology to our considered DoS and performance degradation scenarios, and dissect existing threats and potential attacks over O-RAN interfaces that may compromise the security of O-RAN architectural deployments. Finally, we identify mechanisms to mitigate risks and discuss approaches aimed at improving the robustness of future O-RAN networks.},

  title={HALE-IoT: Hardening Legacy Internet of Things Devices by Retrofitting Defensive Firmware Modifications and Implants}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={10},
  number={10},
  pages={8371-8394},
  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their firmware are notorious for their lifelong vulnerabilities. As device infection increases, vendors also fail to release patches at a competitive pace. Despite security in acrshort IoT being an active area of research, prior work has mainly focused on vulnerability detection and exploitation, threat modeling, and protocol security. However, these methods are ineffective in preventing attacks against legacy and End-Of-Life devices that are already vulnerable. Current research mainly focuses on implementing and demonstrating the potential of malicious modifications. Hardening emerges as an effective solution to provide acrshort IoT devices with an additional layer of defense. In this article, we bridge these gaps through the design of  $\textit {HALE-IoT}$ , a generically applicable systematic approach to HArdening LEgacy acrshort IoT non-low-end devices by retrofitting defensive firmware modifications without access to the original source code.  $\textit {HALE-IoT}$  approaches this nontrivial task via binary firmware reversing and modification while being underpinned by a semiautomated toolset that aims to keep cybersecurity of such devices in a hale state. Our focus is on both modern and, especially, legacy or obsolete acrshort IoT devices as they become increasingly prevalent. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HALE-IoT, we apply it to a wide range of acrshort IoT devices by retrofitting 395 firmware images with defensive implants containing an intrusion prevention system in the form of a Web Application Firewall (for prevention of Web-attack vectors), and an HTTPS-proxy (for latest and full end-to-end HTTPS support) using emulation. We also test our approach on four physical devices, where we show that HALE-IoT successfully runs on protected and quite constrained devices with as low as 32 MB of RAM and 8 MB of storage. Overall, in our evaluation, we achieve good performance and reliability with a remarkably accurate detection and prevention rate for attacks coming from both real CVEs and synthetic exploits.},

  abstract={Waste management is a challenge for modern cities as it impacts on environmental sustainability and on the level of quality perceived by citizens. In the last few years, several progresses have been made in this direction with the introduction in the city of door-to-door separate waste collection. A key element for the success of such actions is to achieve excellent cooperation from citizens. The Digital Transformation process in this sector will require time other than a careful management of the data associated with the waste collection processes. At this regard, the progress of hardware and software technologies enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) will contribute significantly to accelerate the whole process. Among these innovative solutions, the use of RFID tags with augmented capabilities and cloud-based software architectures capable of properly managing collected data will be crucial to obtain an intelligent and efficient waste management system. In this paper, an innovative system capable of capturing and processing data relating to the door-to-door separate waste collection in the context of future smart cities is presented. In particular, the system includes an innovative RFID sensor-tag equipped with low-cost weight sensors and a Cloud software system capable of managing the collected data and satisfying the various stakeholders' expectations. First results on both functional and performance validation of the overall system are shown.},

  title={An OCR Post-Correction Approach Using Deep Learning for Processing Medical Reports}, 
  year={2022},

  pages={2574-2581},
  abstract={According to a recent Deloitte study, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to place a huge strain on the global health care sector. Covid-19 has also catalysed digital transformation across the sector for improving operational efficiencies. As a result, the amount of digitally stored patient data such as discharge letters, scan images, test results or free text entries by doctors has grown significantly. In 2020, 2314 exabytes of medical data was generated globally. This medical data does not conform to a generic structure and is mostly in the form of unstructured digitally generated or scanned paper documents stored as part of a patient’s medical reports. This unstructured data is digitised using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process. A key challenge here is that the accuracy of the OCR process varies due to the inability of current OCR engines to correctly transcribe scanned or handwritten documents in which text may be skewed, obscured or illegible. This is compounded by the fact that processed text is comprised of specific medical terminologies that do not necessarily form part of general language lexicons. The proposed work uses a deep neural network based self-supervised pre-training technique: Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (RoBERTa) that can learn to predict hidden (masked) sections of text to fill in the gaps of non-transcribable parts of the documents being processed. Evaluating the proposed method on domain-specific datasets which include real medical documents, shows a significantly reduced word error rate demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.},

  title={AI Driven Fraud Detection Models in Financial Networks: A Comprehensive Systematic Review}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={13},
  number={},
  pages={141204-141233},
  abstract={Rapid advancements in digital innovation and globalization has significantly increased the complexity of financial networks, making them more vulnerable to fraud. Traditional fraud detection methods struggle to keep pace with evolving fraudulent strategies, contributing to an estimated global financial loss of  ${\$}~5$  trillion. In response, this review paper explores the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial fraud detection, highlighting machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid models as transformative solutions. By analyzing vast datasets, AI can uncover hidden fraud patterns and dynamically adapt to emerging threats. Techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, along with advanced approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have proven particularly effective in detecting various types of financial fraud, including payment fraud, identity theft, and money laundering. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of AI-driven fraud detection methodologies, synthesizing insights from a substantial number of research papers. It systematically categorizes fraud detection techniques based on their application in different types of fraud, providing a structured framework to understand their effectiveness. In addition, it examines the role of cloud computing, edge AI, and distributed systems in enabling real-time transaction monitoring and fraud detection. Although AI significantly improves detection accuracy, reduces operational costs, and strengthens regulatory compliance, challenges such as model explainability, data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and the dynamic nature of fraud remain critical barriers to widespread adoption. Our review highlights the need for collaborative efforts among financial institutions, regulators, and technology providers to address these challenges. Future research should focus on improving the transparency of the AI model, integrating AI with blockchain for secure data sharing, and leveraging federated learning to enhance fraud detection capabilities. By addressing these challenges, AI can play a pivotal role in securing financial systems, minimizing fraud risks, and fostering cross-industry collaboration for more resilient fraud detection frameworks.},

  abstract={In Baijiu brewing process, suppliers may adulterate glutinous sorghum with commercially inferior japonica sorghum, which can affect the yield and quality of the final Baijiu production. Currently, sorghum adulteration detection in Baijiu brewing process in China is carried out manually by sampling and observation, which strongly depends on the experiences of workers. In this paper, we proposed a method that uses sorghum images as input and combines image processing and deep neural networks to identify grain varieties and calculate the adulteration ratio. Two derivative networks of CNN, i.e., ResNet and SqueezeNet are used to implement the deep neural networks for sorghum grain identification and adulteration ratio calculation. The classification accuracy of the ResNet and SqueezeNet based models reached 93.34% and 87.98% on test set, respectively. The root mean squared error (RSME) for adulteration ratio estimation is 4.95% and 7.73%, respectively. The mean absolute error (MAE) is 4.20% and 6.29% accordingly. The proposed pipeline is capable of realizing rapid and non-destructive adulteration detection of raw materials in industrial production, thus conducing to the industrial digital transformation and efficiency improvement.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaping the future of the automotive industry. Grounded on the advances in everything from sensors, electronic controllers, artificial intelligence, data analytics, to network connectivity, intelligent connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have become the essence in IoT applications. The software in CAVs lies at the core of this digital transformation. Faulty software remains the main reason behind the vast number of safety recalls and reputation damage witnessed recently in the automotive industry. The uniqueness of CAVs originates challenges for vehicle software engineering (VSE) that render traditional models and practical solutions for software development ineffective and inapplicable. Despite the raised necessity to adopt a software engineering model that can handle these challenges, there is a lack of studies recognizing the importance of VSE. This article presents an in-depth and comprehensive analysis to perceive the existing software engineering processes detailing their strengths and limitations in the context of CAVs. It also reviews current practical software solutions, including standards, tools, languages, and research efforts to understand the evolution, trends, and current practice in this article area. This article will enable automakers and software providers to better assess and differentiate among the existing software engineering processes and current practical solutions for vehicle software system development. Hence, they would be able to adopt a VSE model and follow best practices that can better meet their challenging needs.},

  pages={13840-13851},
  abstract={With the digitalization of manufacturing, firms can now increasingly access and analyze data in real-time, enabling data-driven decision-making (DDM) also at the operational level. Using a multilevel perspective and a mixed-methods research, this article aims to test whether production workers’ involvement (organizational level) and frontline managers’ competency (individual level) are associated with the use of operational DDM. The results of the regression models based on a survey of Italian auto suppliers show that high-involvement lean production practices are associated with a higher probability of DDM adoption when controlling for Team Leaders’ and Supervisors’ competency level, which have a positive moderation effect. Triangulated with qualitative interview data, these findings suggest that firms with skilled frontline managers are more likely to adopt DDM as they can leverage their production workers’ context-dependent knowledge for sense-making, information processing, and knowledge creation. Also, the moderation effect is stronger for Team Leaders, suggesting a central role for them in firms’ digitalization. This study contributes to literature with a socio-technical model that describes operational DDM by integrating organizational and individual dimensions into the data-information-knowledge-decision-making cycle. Organizational and individual implications of this skill-biased technological and organizational change are discussed, and recommendations are offered to managers and education policymakers.},
