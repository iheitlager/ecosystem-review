	abstract = {While digitalization is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of competitive advantage, existing literature has predominantly examined its impact on supply chain resilience and efficiency, with limited attention to its spillover effects across supply chains. This study addresses this gap by introducing the supply chain spillover perspective to investigate how digital transformation (DT) in focal firms influences their customers' technological innovation. We also analyze the direct and indirect mechanisms through which this effect occurs. Using panel data from Chinese listed companies (2018–2023), we employ a two-way fixed effects model and a Probit model to assess the impact of focal firms' DT on customers' innovation input and output probabilities. Our results indicate that focal firms’ DT significantly enhances their customers' innovation input and output. Grounded in signaling theory, open innovation, and market competition theories, we find that alleviating financing constraints, fostering cooperative innovation, and intensifying industry competition are main indirect impact mechanisms. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that the effect is more pronounced in industries with higher levels of digitalization, among state-owned enterprises in terms of innovation input and private firms in terms of output, as well as among market-leading firms and within supply chains characterized by stronger inter-firm linkages. Our findings suggest that managers should formulate DT strategies from an industrial chain perspective, enhancing their technological innovation capabilities by establishing deep collaborative relationships with supply chain partners and actively participating in digital innovation platforms. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study aims to examine the macro and micro factors that influence the adoption of B2B e-commerce among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Mongolia. The purpose of the study is to identify the extent to which national readiness, industry readiness, organizational readiness, and market readiness affect different levels of e-commerce adoption. A survey was conducted with 102 SMEs from diverse sectors, and the data were analyzed using SPSS 28 for descriptive and preliminary statistics, while Smart PLS-4 was employed to perform structural equation modeling. The results demonstrate that organizational readiness consistently emerges as the most significant determinant across all adoption levels, highlighting the critical role of leadership, infrastructure, and employee skills. Market readiness was found to strongly influence early adoption, suggesting that customer and supplier expectations act as powerful drivers for SMEs to adopt e-commerce solutions. Conversely, industry readiness exhibited a negative effect at the initial stages and became irrelevant at higher levels of adoption. National readiness showed no significant impact at any level, indicating that macro-level improvements in infrastructure and policies alone do not automatically translate into higher e-commerce adoption among SMEs. These findings contribute to the theoretical advancement of the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework by emphasizing firm-level and market-driven factors as stronger predictors of adoption than national or industry-level conditions. Practically, the results suggest that policymakers should prioritize programs that strengthen SMEs’ internal digital capacities and market responsiveness rather than relying solely on national-level interventions. For business owners, the study underscores the importance of investing in digital infrastructure, human capital, and organizational culture to successfully integrate e-commerce practices. The findings not only provide valuable insights for Mongolia but also offer implications for other developing economies where SMEs face similar structural challenges in digital transformation. © 2026, Malque Publishing.

	abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the impact of digital technology adoption on efficiency, transparency and accountability in zakat management, with a focus on the younger generation and highly educated individuals. Using quantitative analysis of 400 respondents in Tangerang city, the findings show that digital zakat adoption is more dominant among the 18-34 age group and respondents with a bachelor’s degree or higher education. This group is more prepared to use digital platforms because of better access to technology and a greater understanding of its benefits. However, digital literacy gaps and limited access remain major challenges, particularly for older adults and low-income communities. The findings highlight that technology adoption, zakat ecosystem strengthening, and community involvement significantly influence operational efficiency and transparency in zakat management. This research contributes to the literature on zakat digitalization and offers strategic recommendations for zakat institutions to optimize technology adoption, emphasizing an inclusive approach that considers the demographic characteristics of users. Collaboration among zakat institutions, the government, and technology providers is essential to ensure successful technology integration and to meet the public’s demand for more transparent and efficient zakat services. © (c) 2026 The Authors.

We examine how collaborative geographic distance and technological similarity influence firms' innovation performance within the digital innovation context. We also investigate the moderating roles of firms' recombinative potential and partner network position. Analyzing a sample of Chinese automobile firms, we reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between geographic distance and innovation performance, whereas technological similarity exerts a positive linear effect with temporal heterogeneity. Furthermore, recombinative potential positively (negatively) moderates the distance-performance (similarity-performance) relationship. Conversely, partner network position negatively (positively) moderates the distance-performance (similarity-performance) effect. This study contributes by empirically establishing partner selection's distinct impacts (geography and technology) within the digital innovation context, revealing geographic distance's non-linear effect. It advances knowledge recombination and innovation network theories by uncovering the dual (positive/negative) moderating influence of recombinative potential and partner network position.

	abstract = {The integration of blockchain technology into higher education institutions (HEIs) represents a transformative step toward securing, automating, and decentralizing the management of academic records. In many developing countries, the persistent challenges of identity fraud, document loss, administrative delays, and inefficient verification systems hinder institutional transparency and student mobility. This study explores the application of blockchain-based smart contracts to improve student data governance and verification across South African universities. Drawing from bibliometric analysis and real-world case studies, including the collaboration between First National Bank (FNB) and the Department of Home Affairs, the research examines blockchain’s feasibility for adoption in higher education systems. The study also captures qualitative insights into institutional readiness and policy gaps. The bibliometric component analyzed peer-reviewed literature published between 2015 and 2024 using databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore, focusing on citation trends, keyword co-occurrence, and thematic clusters. Findings reveal growing interest in blockchain-enabled solutions for credential verification, enrollment automation, and funding disbursement. Case studies underscore that while South African institutions often rely on outdated, paper-based record systems, blockchain offers a cost-effective and secure alternative that aligns with national policies like the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA). Smart contracts, in particular, can automate tuition processing, bursary validation, and inter-institutional credit transfer. This study proposes a scalable model for blockchain adoption in HEIs, emphasizing regulatory compliance, digital infrastructure readiness, and public-private partnerships. By leveraging blockchain’s tamper-proof and decentralized architecture, HEIs can streamline data operations, reduce administrative burdens, and enhance trust between students, institutions, employers, and state bodies. The research contributes a policy-aligned framework that supports the broader digital transformation agenda in South Africa’s higher education sector. © 2026, Malque Publishing.

This strategy–enabling value co-creation among manufacturers, customers, and partners–creates a competitive advantage for B2B firms. However, previous research has identified paradoxes in which these firms do not achieve the expected financial performance from investments in DS, referred to as the DS paradox. These paradoxes raise uncertainty about the short-term return on DS investments. In addition, little research has examined the various types of digital service offerings (DSOs) and their impact on firm performance. To address these gaps, we developed a measure of DS and constructed a typology of DSOs based on the level of DS orientation, using textual analysis of firm annual reports. We found an inverted U-shaped relationship between DS and firm profitability. We also observed heterogeneity in profitability across six DSOs. In doing so, we contribute to the studies of digital transformation in B2B sectors by clarifying the relationship between DS and firm profitability and by examining the variation in profitability across different types of DSOs, informed by intra- and interorganizational paradoxes inherent in DS. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Supply chains are undergoing rapid digital transformation, yet little is known about how digital technologies reshape workers' activities and the role of knowledge sharing in this process. A human-centered perspective is essential to align process improvements with worker outcomes. This study investigates how digital technologies support core supply chain management (SCM) activities, how knowledge-sharing practices influence them, and how their interaction affects supply chain performance and worker outcomes. We surveyed 370 companies and applied regression models to examine the relationships between digital technology adoption, knowledge sharing, SCM activities, and performance outcomes. To contextualize the survey findings, we conducted a post-hoc qualitative longitudinal case study of a supply chain digitalization project involving the focal company and six key partners—three suppliers and three customers. Results show that digital technologies enable smart working environments, enhancing SCM processes and outcomes. However, knowledge sharing interacts negatively with digital technologies in supporting workers’ SCM activities: explicit knowledge sharing becomes less critical with front-end smart working technologies, while tacit knowledge sharing is less necessary with extensive use of base digital technologies. Front-end technologies influence worker outcomes indirectly through their effects on SCM activities, whereas base technologies have both direct and mediated effects on worker outcomes and supply chain performance. The qualitative findings reveal the distinct digital capabilities implemented and their impact on workers. These findings challenge the assumption that knowledge sharing always complements digital tools, suggesting that digitalization can reduce reliance on external knowledge and offer managerial insights for designing human-centered smart work environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study explores how sensor-based technologies can support Lean replenishment in food retail environments. The main objective is to present the development and early implementation of the Stockout Detection and Monitoring System (SDMS), a prototype designed to detect stockouts in real time and support flow-based replenishment. The research follows an action research methodology. It involves five iterative stages: diagnosis, planning, action, observation, and reflection. Data were collected through direct observations, ergonomic assessments (REBA and NIOSH), technical monitoring, and collaboration with store teams and technology partners. Initial results show that the SDMS achieved 84% detection accuracy and 96% shelf coverage. It successfully identified key stockout zones and reduced reliance on manual inspection. Real-time dashboards were developed to visualize product availability and prioritize replenishment. Sensor calibration proved effective even in complex conditions, such as reflective packaging. The system contributes to both operational efficiency and Lean learning. It supports real-time decision-making, reduces physical strain on workers, and minimizes unnecessary product handling. These outcomes align with Lean principles of waste reduction, flow optimization, and respect for people. Although still in validation, the system shows strong potential for future integration with ERP and ESL platforms. Future research will focus on scaling the system, improving detection logic, and collecting user feedback from store personnel. The SDMS provides a concrete example of how digital tools can reinforce Lean practices in complex retail operations and offers new perspectives for smart retail transformation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

This work incorporates Circular Economy (CE) practices into the SC5.0 framework and introduces a novel multi-stage decision-making model for designing Circular Supply Chains (CSCs). In the first stage, the study identifies the key indicators associated with both the CE and I5.0, and evaluates their relative importance using the Stochastic Fuzzy Best-Worst Method (SFBWM). In the next stage, the performance of potential Raw Material Providers (RMPs) is assessed through a newly developed approach, the Stochastic Fuzzy Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (SFVIKOR) method. Following these evaluations, a Robust Stochastic–Possibilistic (RSP) optimization model is formulated with the objective of minimizing costs, Greenhouse Gas (GhG) emissions, and energy consumption, while simultaneously maximizing job creation and Supply Chain (SC) visibility. The proposed framework is validated through a real-world case study in the home appliances sector. To generate optimal solutions, the Chebyshev Multi-Choice Goal Programming with Utility Function (CMCGP-UF) method is applied. The results highlight that robustness, cost efficiency, product quality, waste management, GhG emissions, information system adoption, and workplace safety are the most critical criteria influencing Supply Chain Network Design (SCND). Moreover, the findings indicate that the integration of blockchain-based Information-Sharing Systems (ISSs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) can significantly enhance transparency, adaptability, and overall SC performance. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

The model’s convergence is evident, with the global loss reducing from 1.345 in the initial round to 0.395 after 50 communication rounds. Furthermore, the impact of privacy budgets (ϵ) on performance was analyzed, showing that even with a highly stringent budget (ϵ=0.5), the framework maintains an accuracy of 93.0% and an F1-score of 91.2%. Communication efficiency optimizations reduce data exchange by up to 90%, demonstrating scalability across distributed healthcare systems. These results highlight the potential of the FL framework to transform healthcare analytics, ensuring privacy, accuracy, and efficiency in a multi-stakeholder environment. This study sets a foundation for deploying FL in real-world healthcare settings, addressing critical challenges in data security and collaborative analytics. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2026.},

	abstract = {In the context of digital transformation, building information modeling technological innovation (BIM-TI) has emerged as a critical element in enhancing design integration, data analysis, and intelligent construction processes. While technologies such as digital twins, big data, and the internet of things have evolved alongside BIM, BIM-TI refers to the innovation of BIM within the broader context of digital transformation. Although previous research focused on isolated influencing factors or general adoption frameworks, a lack of clarity remained regarding the key drivers and their interaction, especially in megaprojects. This study aimed to examine the factors influencing BIM-TI in megaprojects and to identify the configurations. The objective was to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding the mechanisms driving BIM-TI. To address this knowledge gap, the technological conditions, organizational capabilities, construction scenarios, environmental pressures (TOCE) framework was developed by introducing construction scenarios as a fourth dimension, as an extension of the traditional technology-organization-environment (TOE) model. It reflects the practical contexts in which BIM has been applied, including collaborative design, intelligent manufacturing, intelligent site, intelligent operation, and green construction. This study explored the influencing and configurational paths of BIM-TI using structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The findings indicated that technological conditions, organizational capabilities, construction scenarios, and environmental pressures were key drivers of BIM-TI, with environmental pressures playing a moderating role. Four distinct configurational paths were identified, highlighting the core role of environmental pressures and their synergistic effects with either technological conditions or organizational capabilities. This study enriches the theoretical foundation by extending the TOE model to the TOCE framework and provides a novel configuration for BIM-TI mechanisms in megaprojects. These insights offered practical guidance for project managers and engineers, industry leaders and technology providers, and policymakers to foster BIM-TI. © 2025 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Corporate uniforms for the luxury services sector are workwear apparel with specific affordances, designed and produced for private business entities by specialized suppliers. In the fashion and luxury fields, research on corporate uniforms for the services sector is limited, particularly with regard to the niche topic of bespoke luxury uniforms. The article addresses this gap by discussing the case of Maurel, an Italian family firm which supplies fashion and luxury hospitality, travel and wellness brands with internally styled and tailored corporate uniforms. The study evidences how internal design processes align with models theorized for fashion design and—contrary to what might be expected based on discussions of uniforms—are permeable to fashion trends. It also underscores how digital transformation affects both production and communication strategies, as is currently the case in the fashion and luxury sector. By illustrating how luxury corporate uniforms are fashioned, the article aims to situate this form of dress in two fields wherein further research could be conducted: fashion and luxury tourism activities and practices; and digital fashion and luxury communication. © The Author(s) 2026.},

As markets liberalize and digital transformation accelerates, all these emerging technologies and increasing competition have made retaining customers more complex than ever. Even a slight change in churn rates can translate into serious decline in revenue and operational challenges. This paper investigates churn prediction through analysis of two distinct datasets: a telecom dataset and a subscription platform dataset. We performed an array of machine learning methods including ensemble learners, linear models, tree based classifiers, probabilistic frameworks and hybrid approaches. By evaluating each model's performance before and after hyperparameter tuning, we demonstrate that feature engineering and optimization resulted in improved accuracy. Our findings highlight the value of combining advanced algorithms with processed data sets and parameter adjustments. Ultimately these insights lay the groundwork for more effective customer retention strategies in highly competitive service industries. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

The architecture was implemented and validated in 3 use cases with Enterprise Resource Plannings (ERPs) from the same vendor, different vendors, and communication from a ERP to a Web portal. Implementing the proposed architecture impacted efficiency, transparency, and accountability within the supply chain network. The lead times for purchases, provisioning, and the number of additional information requests in the ordering were reduced. In subcontracting, a reduction in non-conformities and an overall improvement in delivery times were verified. Moreover, logistics operations and communication with subcontractors were optimized, leading to faster order reception and reducing informal contacts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

This paper examines these challenges through a case study of the “Open Educational Resources in Higher Education” MOOC, developed with all partner institutions of the Unite! university alliance. The course was produced in all official alliance languages and used AI-driven tools (HeyGen) to generate multilingual instructor avatars for efficient localization. A key aspect of this MOOC was its open licensing approach. By adopting a Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0) license, the course materials were designed for reuse and dissemination across different educational contexts. To ensure broad accessibility, the MOOC was made available on the Austrian national MOOC platform iMooX.at and embedded within Unite! Metacampus, the alliance’s federated LMS. For this, Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) for cross-platform interactions was used. Through LTI, course activities and materials on iMooX.at were linked to Metacampus, allowing users to access materials, track progress, and interact within a unified learning environment. This strategy supported federated access and engagement across institutional systems. This paper outlines the technical and organizational strategies used in developing the MOOC, discussing key challenges and providing recommendations for openly licensed, AI-supported, and LTI-integrated MOOCs within European university alliances. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of structuring cross-institutional MOOCs that are pedagogically, technologically, and organizationally sustainable while advancing open education principles in higher education. © The Author(s) 2026.},

This study examines the evolving dynamics of Online-to-Offline (O2O) retail, focusing on the integration of offline showroom experience services and online Augmented Reality (AR) endorsements. Offline showrooms allow consumers to evaluate products physically, while AR services provide immersive online experiences. Our findings highlight several interesting yet challenging insights. First, suppliers may shift from single-channel strategies to integrated interaction-based services when both showroom and AR effects are strong; however, when AR effects are weaker, offline showrooms become more dominant. Second, both offline and AR services stimulate respective service investments and improve supplier profitability, revealing the dual role of these channels as both substitutes and complements. Third, suppliers are more likely to pursue integration strategies when integration costs are low, but intriguingly, they may still integrate even under high costs if the interactive benefits are sufficiently large. Finally, pricing and service quality differentiation across channels illustrate the strategic difficulty of maintaining consistency in omnichannel environments. This research underscores the importance of balancing AR and showroom services, with integration offering strategic advantages for businesses like Apple Inc., especially when backed by strong financial resources to support higher integration costs. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The global momentum of digital transformation within the public sector presents a paradox—while promising enhanced service delivery and operational efficiency, it simultaneously exposes governments to vulnerabilities stemming from reliance on transnational digital infrastructures and private technology providers. This study addresses the critical gap in understanding how digital transformation initiatives intersect with digital sovereignty concerns, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Employing a case study research strategy focusing on two LMICs, this study investigates the complex interplay between public sector digital transformation strategies and the preservation of national digital sovereignty. The findings highlight the urgent need for a coherent framework that aligns digital transformation goals with sovereignty objectives to mitigate risks related to data sovereignty (data control, cyber security), technological sovereignty, and policy autonomy. The findings of the study contribute to a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities in achieving successful but sovereign digital transformation in LMICs contexts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

	abstract = {Robotic Process Automation has emerged as a key driver of digital transformation by enabling organizations to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks with minimal disruption to existing IT systems. Its core strength lies in GUI-based automation, allowing rapid deployment, particularly in legacy environments. Simultaneously, software vendors are evolving RPA into end-to-end automation platforms by integrating APIs, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, thereby supporting advanced paradigms such as intelligent and hyper-automation. The evolving definitions and perceptions of RPA—and its shifting role within the broader automation technology landscape—are outlined in the state of knowledge section. This paper investigates how RPA aligns with the broader domain of process automation and the role it is expected to play in the future. It further explores RPA’s unique capabilities in contrast to other automation technologies, its current areas of application, and prospective functionalities that may enhance its accessibility and usability. Based on a detailed qualitative study involving 13 expert interviews with developers, consultants, researchers, and vendors, the research applies detailed In Vivo and Concept coding with 805 emerging codes leading to three thematic pillars: core RPA capabilities, RPA as a component of integrated automation platforms, and general automation strategies. The findings offer a forward-looking view on the strategic development and practical impact of RPA in enterprise contexts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

It seeks to answer the key research question: does participation in the Erasmus + Programme impact on the development of digital transformation and digital competences in participating organizations? Data were collected through an online survey of project coordinators and in-depth (structured) interviews with organizational leaders. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used. The empirical findings, based on the responses of principals and Erasmus + project coordinators, show that participating organizations perceive a significant impact of Erasmus + on the development of digital transformation and digital competences, especially in KA2 strategic partnership projects. Considerable differences were identified among participating organizations, in terms of the level of achieved digital transformation and the digital competence index of coordinators – it is lowest in the school education sector and highest in adult education. Organizations whose headteachers or other educational heads foster digital culture and demonstrate a prominent level of digital literacy through their leadership and use of digital technologies were shown to have a distinct advantage. The national agency CMEPIUS can support participating organizations by further investigating the causes of differences, strengthening the involvement of organizations in KA2 projects, and encouraging the enhancement of digital competencies of principals, coordinators, and other school staff through professional training and cooperation among organizations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.},

This study developed a multimodal neural network to automate assessments of patient-generated data from remote postoperative wound monitoring. Two interventional studies including adult gastrointestinal surgery patients collected wound images and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for 30-days postoperatively. Neural networks for PROMs and images were combined to predict surgical site infection (SSI) diagnosis within 48 h. The multimodal neural network model to predict confirmed SSI within 48 h remained comparable to clinician triage (0.762 [0.690–0.835] vs 0.777 [0.721–0.832]), with an excellent performance on external validation. Simulated usage indicated an 80% reduction in staff time (51.5 to 9.1 h) without compromising diagnostic accuracy. This multimodal approach can effectively support remote monitoring, alleviating provider burden while ensuring high-quality postoperative care. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {In vocational education and training, it can be assumed that the digital transformation increases the relevance of individuals’ cross-occupational collaboration competency (COCC) across vocational and professional sectors, thus improving and reorganizing processes across time and domains on the basis of available information. This poses a challenge to instruction and diagnostics in VET, which can be supported by thorough, empirically grounded theoretical modeling. In Striković and Wittmann (2022), we suggested a role-theoretical approach to modeling COCC involving five role-theoretical dimensions: knowing one’s own occupational role, knowing the occupational role of one’s collaboration partners, latent processes of role distance, role-taking, and object-oriented role coordination. In the present study, we evaluate this role-theoretical model empirically using the example of nursing, specifying and operationalizing the model with a computer-based situational judgment test and using a data set of 328 nursing students to carry out an in-depth analysis of (1) dimensionality and (2) role-related task features thought to influence item difficulty. While model comparisons showed the superiority of a unidimensional vector compared to five- and two-dimensional structures, linear additive regression analysis revealed that the role-related task features on the basis of the five dimensions showed significant effects, as did the number of collaboration partners and the test subjects’ subject-matter competence, which can also be linked to the nurses’ situational role. These findings are in line with our theoretical reasoning in the COCC model. We discuss their limitations as well as their theoretical and educational significance, outlining needs for further research—also in other professional and vocational domains. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The healthcare sector is experiencing a digital transformation propelled by the Internet of Medical Things (IOMT), real-time patient monitoring, robotic surgery, Electronic Health Records (EHR), medical imaging, and wearable technologies. This proliferation of digital tools generates vast quantities of healthcare data. Efficient and timely analysis of this data is critical for enhancing patient outcomes and optimizing care delivery. Real-time processing of Healthcare Big Data (HBD) offers significant potential for improved diagnostics, continuous monitoring, and effective surgical interventions. However, conventional cloud-based processing systems face challenges due to the sheer volume and time-sensitive nature of this data. The migration of large datasets to centralized cloud infrastructures often results in latency, which impedes real-time applications. Furthermore, network congestion exacerbates these challenges, delaying access to vital insights necessary for informed decision-making. Such limitations hinder healthcare professionals from fully leveraging the capabilities of emerging technologies and big data analytics. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes a Regional Computing (RC) paradigm for the management of HBD. The RC framework establishes strategically positioned regional servers capable of regionally collecting, processing, and storing medical data, thereby reducing dependence on centralized cloud resources, especially during peak usage periods. This innovative approach effectively addresses the constraints of traditional cloud processing, facilitating real-time data analysis at the regional level. Ultimately, it empowers healthcare providers with the timely information required to deliver data-driven, personalized care and optimize treatment strategies. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: Significant inequities persist in hypertension detection and control, with minoritized populations disproportionately experiencing organ damage and premature death due to uncontrolled hypertension. Remote blood pressure monitoring combined with telehealth visits (RBPM) is proving to be an effective strategy for controlling hypertension. Yet there are challenges related to technology adoption, patient engagement and social determinants of health (SDoH), contributing to disparities in patient outcomes. This review summarizes the evidence to date for RBPM, focusing on the potential to advance health equity in blood pressure control and the existing levers for largescale implementation. Recent Findings: Several studies demonstrate the promise of RBPM programs to address health disparities through: (1) the use of cellular-enabled blood pressure machines that do not require internet access or smart devices to connect readings into the medical record; (2) emphasis on home blood pressure monitoring to illuminate the daily factors that influence blood pressure control, thereby increasing patient empowerment; (3) adoption of standardized algorithms for hypertension management; and (4) integration of services to address SDoH. Multidisciplinary, non-physician care teams that include nurses, pharmacists, and community health workers are integral to this model. However, most studies have not embraced all aspects of RBPM, and implementation is challenging as current payment models do not support the digital components of RBPM or a diverse workforce of hypertension providers. Conclusion: To address hypertension disparities, RBPM programs need to integrate digital technology that is accessible to all users as well as multidisciplinary care teams that attend to the medical and social needs of populations experiencing health inequities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.},

This study systematically examines the forward spillover effects of supplier firms’ digital transformation. Using panel data from A-share listed companies in China over the period 2007–2022, we focus on vertical supply chain linkages. The results indicate that supplier firms’ digital transformation significantly reduces customer firms’ environmental pollution emissions, a conclusion that remains robust across various tests. Moreover, we find that this effect is asymmetric: it is significantly stronger when suppliers’ digitalization levels exceed those of their customers. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the pollution-reduction effect is stronger when customer firms are located in regions with lower resource endowments, have higher supply-chain dependence, operate in non-heavy-pollution industries, or are non-state-owned enterprises. Mechanism analysis demonstrates that supplier digitalization achieves these gains by enhancing green technological innovation and increasing external stakeholder attention. The findings provide a foundation for fully leveraging the environmental potential of digital transformation within supply chains and offer important insights into advancing supply chain modernization and promoting green, high-quality development. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Supply chain digitalization presents significant potential for aligning economic growth with environmental sustainability; however, the mechanisms through which it enhances carbon emission efficiency remain insufficiently explored in emerging economies. This study investigates the impact of digital transformation on corporate carbon performance in China, utilizing the Supply Chain Innovation and Application Pilot Initiative as a quasi-natural experiment. By analyzing data from Chinese A-share listed companies between 2013 and 2021 using a difference-in-differences approach, the study finds that pilot companies exhibited a substantial improvement in carbon emission efficiency. Two key mechanisms drive this effect: first, external collaboration, wherein digital platforms facilitate co-innovation with supply chain partners to develop low-carbon solutions, and second, internal capability restructuring, which optimizes management processes and promotes data-driven decision-making. The heterogeneity analysis identifies stronger effects in firms characterized by mature governance, non-state ownership, and involvement in competitive, low-pollution industries. These findings contribute to the advancement of green development theory by illustrating how digitalization functions as a dual catalyst, reshaping internal organizational capabilities and nurturing external innovation ecosystems. The study offers empirical insights from China’s institutional context, providing guidance for achieving climate-industrial compatibility in emerging economies while emphasizing the need for context-specific validation across different institutional environments. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The rapid aging of global populations necessitates innovative aged care solutions, with smart service platforms emerging as a promising approach. However, data silos, high costs, and weak user engagement hinder their sustainable development, particularly in China where government-led platforms dominate through public-private partnerships. Hence, the study aims to investigate the influencing factors of sustainable development and identify optimal strategies to balance data utility with privacy protection. The study employs a novel mixed-methods approach combining case analysis of three regional platforms with multi-agent simulation modeling. The case studies identified 20 critical sustainability factors using the TOUE (Technology-Organization-User-Environment) framework, including data governance, service innovation, information literacy, policy support, etc. The multi-agent model simulates interactions among governments, platforms, providers, and recipients under varying data-sharing scenarios. Simulation results indicate that the sustainable development of aged care platforms requires a delicate equilibrium - where data sharing serves as both a catalyst for service innovation and a responsibility demanding governance. The study also reveals the diminishing returns of excessive data security investments, suggesting an optimal threshold for sustainable operations. The study makes theoretical contributions by advancing the complex adaptive systems theory in the context of aged care ecosystems and also contributes to the discourse on sustainable digital transformation based on insights from China's rapidly aging context, with implications for public sector datafication and optimizing data sharing strategies in public-private partnership models. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The rapid proliferation of Online Food Delivery Platforms (OFDP) has transformed food consumption patterns among university students. However, the environmental implications of this digital shift, particularly in terms of food waste, remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap by examining how behavioral mechanisms embedded in digital food environments—such as over-ordering, portion-size mismatch, and algorithm-driven promotions—affect food waste generation among Indonesian students. Using cross-sectional data from 1042 respondents and applying a Conditional Mixed Process (CMP) estimation strategy, the findings show that more frequent OFDP usage significantly increases food waste, both in total and across categories such as proteins, dairy, fruits, and vegetables. The mechanism operates through the convenience and impulsivity induced by platform design, which weakens users’ ability to plan and manage food portions effectively. The results demonstrate that while OFDPs provide convenience and accessibility, they also contribute directly to unsustainable consumption by amplifying food waste levels. Policy recommendations emphasize the integration of digital feedback systems in OFDP apps (e.g., smart portion indicators and waste warnings), university-based food waste audits through the Kampus Merdeka program, and cross-sector collaboration between platform providers and regulators to align digital innovation with sustainability goals. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions from platform providers, universities, and policymakers to mitigate the environmental consequences of digital food consumption. Overall, this study contributes to the literature on sustainable consumption and food system digitalization by revealing the behavioral and technological mechanisms linking OFDP usage to food waste among young consumers in Indonesia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

Predominant countries such as the USA, Australia, and China underscore the global and collaborative nature of this research. Central themes addressed include data production, cloud computing, and data security, each varying regionally in emphasis. A notable transition is observed from foundational and academic research to practical applications and advanced technologies. Moving forward, to standardize data markets, academia should establish theoretical frameworks, integrate security governance, and refine evaluation systems. Governments should enhance legal oversight, foster cross-sector collaboration, and accelerate ecosystem development for public management modernization. Data vendors require end-to-end security compliance, technical standardization, and market-driven innovation to maintain competitive sustainability.

	abstract = {Background Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant potential to enhance the quality of life (QoL) for individuals with disabilities by improving access to healthcare, promoting social participation, and supporting independence. In Saudi Arabia, however, there is a gap in inclusive AI models tailored to local needs, particularly in addressing the challenges faced by people with disabilities in accessing essential services. Aims This article proposes an AI-supported application tailored to improve key QoL dimensions such as healthcare accessibility, social inclusion, and autonomy for people with disabilities in Saudi Arabia. Methods A qualitative design was employed, involving 25 semi-structured interviews: 10 experts from medicine, rehabilitation, sociology, and AI and 15 individuals with visual, motor, or mild cognitive disabilities. Participants were recruited through rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and disability associations in Al-Ahsa using official approvals and direct outreach via email, WhatsApp, and personal meetings. Thematic analysis was conducted using Braun and Clarke’s framework. Results The proposed AI application supports three key service areas: (1) social services (personalized chatbots, accessibility tools, and AI-driven job matching); (2) health services (telehealth monitoring and genetic-based treatment planning); (3) collaboration with ministries and AI authorities. Sustainability is addressed through measures such as free access, institutional support, and ongoing government involvement. Conclusions This study presents a context-specific, actionable AI framework to inform policy and innovation for disability inclusion in Saudi Arabia. By emphasizing local needs, stakeholder collaboration, and user-centered adaptive design, it contributes to closing the service gap for people with disabilities and offers a scalable model for inclusive digital transformation. © 2025 The Authors.},

Despite extensive theoretical work, a persistent gap exists between understanding the concept and applying it effectively within organizations. This systematic literature review analyzes 50 high-impact articles published since 2000 to identify best practices and barriers to implementing disruptive innovation, with particular attention to the role of open innovation as a catalyst. Findings show that adopting innovative, often collaboratively developed business models reduced market-entry barriers in 68 % of the cases studied. Open innovation practices—such as external partnerships, co-creation with customers, and digital platform collaboration—emerged as critical enablers, alongside organizational culture and customer engagement. Key obstacles include incumbent resistance, rigid performance metrics, and resource allocation constraints. The study contributes theoretically by clarifying conceptual boundaries between disruptive and open innovation, and empirically by offering an actionable framework for leveraging open innovation to foster disruptive change in dynamic markets.

However, how both organizations create public value within this hybrid governance arrangement remains unclear. To address this question, this study explores which combinations of conditions in strategic management and collaborative innovation contribute to public value creation in PPIP, using a fuzzy-set qualitative analysis of the digital innovation in Chinese government hotline services. Results indicate that legally binding contracts enhance material public value, while shared relational norms promote procedural public value. Moreover, risk management, knowledge sharing, and information publicness play crucial roles in the creation of both material and procedural public value. Points for practitioners: The study identifies configurations factors driving public value creation in PPIP, rooted in the dual logics of strategic management and collaborative innovation. Producing and balancing material and procedural public value results from the combination of contractual rigor and relational governance, with complex causal mechanisms. In PPIP, “hard”contractual mechanisms drive MPV-oriented outcomes, while “soft” shared relational norms foster PPV-oriented outcomes. Risk management, shared knowledge bases, and external transparency are core to creating public value in PPIP. © The Author(s) 2025},

	abstract = {As the 2030 deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) approaches, higher education institutions (HEIs) are under increasing pressure to contribute meaningfully to global sustainability efforts. In response, a growing number of digital innovation networks have emerged—transnational, platform-mediated collaborations that connect universities and partners to advance the SDGs. Despite their expanding role, the governance dynamics of such networks remain under-examined. This study investigates how five prominent digital SDG networks in higher education—HESI, SDSN, UGC, COPERNICUS Alliance and AASHE—are governed and how they coordinate action, foster trust and navigate digital mediation. Using a document-based digital ethnography approach and a “simulated participant” perspective, we analyse publicly available data from websites, reports, event recordings and online platforms to reconstruct network practices. Guided by network governance theory, the findings reveal three recurring dynamics: adaptive coordination beyond hierarchy, the construction of “digital trust infrastructures” and the balancing of global missions with local contexts. These networks, while fragile, demonstrate how distributed leadership and digital tools can sustain collective engagement. The study contributes to theoretical debates by extending network governance theory into the digital and transnational domain of higher education and identifies design principles for building robust, inclusive and responsive academic networks. A future research agenda is proposed to address questions of legitimacy, equity, platform governance and long-term impact. As universities reimagine their role in sustainability, understanding how digital innovation networks function is essential to transforming higher education into a globally connected force for sustainable development. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

While the industrial internet of things has the potential to drive green transformation, how it reconstructs green intellectual capital to foster green innovation remains underexplored. This study addresses this critical gap by adopting a three-wave longitudinal survey of 543 Chinese star-rated hotels and applying a hybrid SEM-ANN model to analyze both linear and nonlinear dynamics among industrial internet of things, green intellectual capital, and green innovation. The results reveal that industrial internet of things integration directly promotes green innovation (β = 0.214, p < 0.001) and indirectly drives green innovation by enhancing green intellectual capital dimensions: green human capital (β = 0.324) through digital skill upgrading, green structural capital (β = 0.450) via improved digital governance, and green relational capital (β = 0.360) by enabling cross-sectoral partnerships. Mediation analysis confirms that green intellectual capital partially mediates the IIoT–GI relationship (p < 0.05). Notably, ANN analysis shows that green relational capital exerts the strongest nonlinear influence on green innovation. By extending dynamic capabilities theory, this research proposes a novel IIoT–GIC–GI integration model, offering a strategic roadmap for green digital transformation in hospitality. Practically, the findings inform China’s tourism policy goals for 2023–2025 and provide actionable insights for enhancing low-carbon development in star-rated hotels. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: The rapid diffusion of digital technologies throughout the healthcare system has created new opportunities to improve the use, efficiency and continuity of healthcare services. The academic debate has largely explored the implementation of digital tools and their impact on clinical processes and health outcomes. Despite the potential benefits, the digital evolution of the healthcare system could generate or aggravate existing inequalities. Although existing studies on digital technologies in healthcare are consolidated and numerous, little attention has been paid to the emergence of inequalities at individual, organisational and system levels. To fill this gap, this study aims to focus on how emerging inequalities are framed in the academic debate, with a focus on the socio-demographic, technological and organisational factors of digital evolution of the healthcare system. This study is based on a knowledge management perspective. Methods: This study uses a scoping review approach and is carried out following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The search was conducted without time limits on three databases, and only peer-reviewed articles in English were included. The review included qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods studies. Three analysis domains were identified: sociodemographic factors, technological factors and health and healthcare-related factors. A bibliometric and co-occurrence analysis was also conducted using VOSviewer to visualise the structure of the research landscape and identify thematic clusters. Results: From 3,303 reviewed articles, 64 studies met the inclusion criteria. The results highlight that the digital evolution of the healthcare system can exacerbate the exposure of new social categories to inequalities. The factors of emerging inequalities in the digital evolution of healthcare have been identified and classified into three areas: (1) socio-demographic factors, (2) technological factors and (3) organisational and systemic factors. Three different historical periods have been identified within the academic debate. In fact, through in-depth analysis and bibliometric analysis, we have observed an increasing diversification of the topics. Conclusion: Digitalisation of healthcare can generate inequalities. Although research on this topic in the literature is scarce, a growing number of scholars have begun to address it. Future research should explore user experiences, the effectiveness of healthcare provider training, coordination mechanisms and public reimbursement policies to reduce inequalities. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Trustworthy carbon footprint data is increasingly critical for organic food supply chains, yet many existing systems lack transparency, credibility, and cross-sector integration particularly in emerging economies. This research aims to develop a blockchain-based traceability system that addresses these gaps through a sustainability-driven, multi-stakeholder approach. Grounded in the Quintuple Helix Innovation (5HI) model, the study incorporates perspectives from government, industry, academia, civil society, and environmental actors to co-create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) tailored to Thailand's organic agriculture sector. Data were gathered from in-depth interviews with key stakeholders including farmers, processors, logistics providers, retailers, certifiers, regulators, system developers, and consumers supported by document analysis of relevant agricultural, climate, and blockchain-related policies. The resulting MVP integrates mobile applications, IoT sensors, and blockchain verification for real-time carbon tracking and transparent certification. The originality of this study lies in operationalizing the 5HI framework into a practical, participatory MVP design that merges technical feasibility with environmental and institutional accountability. Findings show promise in reducing certification fraud and enhancing traceability legitimacy, although implementation challenges such as interoperability, startup costs, and rural access persist. This work contributes a replicable model for sustainable digital transformation in agri-food innovation. © 2025 The Authors},

This study analyzes supply chain data from A-share listed companies in China (2007–2022) using the fixed effects model, instrumental variable techniques, Heckman two-stage model, and mechanism test model to examine the spillover effects of upstream and downstream enterprises’ digital transformation on midstream enterprises’ total factor productivity and its underlying mechanisms. The results show that: (1) Digital transformation by upstream and downstream supply chain partners significantly enhances the total factor productivity of midstream enterprises—a finding that remains robust across multiple tests. (2) This effect operates through two main channels: technological progress and factor reallocation. The former is driven by enhanced digital adoption, increased research and development investment, and improved innovation quality, while the latter optimizes capital allocation and upgrades the labor structure. (3) The spillover effect is stronger when firms are geographically distant, operate in different industries, or when midstream enterprises exhibit higher supply chain dependency. This study offers theoretical insights and practical guidance for promoting high-quality development through supply chain-oriented digital transformation strategies. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Brazil is largely occupied by pastures under varying conditions, rising needs for systematic assessment of soil fertility and improvement of management strategies. Soil analyses are valuable tools for fertility assessment, but its use can be amplified to foster information exchanges between farmers, service providers and fertilizer vendors in broader scales. So, our objective was to characterize the fertility dynamic of Brazilian pastures through its soil chemical and physical properties. We employed soil analysis results collected from different land uses (pasture, integrated system, and native vegetation), soil depths (0–5 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm) and textural classes extracted from the Brazilian Soil Classification System to determine Land Use Fertility Profiles based on two core dimensions representing soil fertility and acidity, addressing 35 % and 24 % of the total variance, respectively. Stratified comparisons showed that the acidity dimension distinguished native vegetation from integrated system soils; fertility differences between textural groups in superficial layers were more frequent among pastures samples than among integrated systems ones and diminished in depth. The acidity dimension remained differing sandy and medium texture soils from clayey and heavy clayey ones. In the crossed comparisons, our results indicated that sandy soils under pasture concentrate their heterogeneity in deeper layers (20–30 cm). Thus, sampling schemes should be conducted up to these depths to improve efficiency in management strategies. This approach aimed at contributing to the data-modeling scope of agribusiness digital transformation and to the global agenda for sustainable food supply by enhancing soil fertility efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

The analysis reveals that digital transformation significantly reduces supply chain carbon emissions through environmental information spillovers and green innovation spillovers. Moreover, the effects are strengthened by greater environmental regulatory intensity and executives’ environmental awareness. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the reduction impact of digital transformation is more pronounced in the eastern and western regions, and is stronger among high-tech and low-pollution industries. Furthermore, the effect is greater for upstream suppliers than for downstream customers. These findings underscore the broader environmental benefits of digital transformation from a network perspective and offer theoretical support for both government policy design and corporate supply chain decarbonization strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive framework for digitalizing traditional agri-food supply chains (TASCs) in developing economies, paving the way towards digital transformation. Digitizing is the initial step of digital transformation, which is the conversion of analog information into digital form. Digitalization is the use of digital technologies to improve existing processes, and digital transformation is the comprehensive integration of digital technologies to fundamentally reshape operations and business models. TASCs in developing economies rely on manual information, leading to inefficiencies and resource wastage. Employing an abductive reasoning approach, the study investigates a case study in a developing economy. A social network analysis was conducted along with process mapping for the identified case study to evaluate stakeholder interactions, identifying key metrics like degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality. The study identified farming input suppliers, agriculture field officers and distribution center managers as critical influencing stakeholders in this social network. The framework introduced in the study emphasizes regulated digitalization, where governing bodies oversee seed supply and production planning to ensure alignment with market demand. The proposed framework offers benefits for all supply chain stakeholders while improving transparency, optimizing resources, leading to improved production planning, minimized post-harvest wastage, reducing price volatility and increasing food security. The framework offers strategic insights for both policymakers and researchers aiming to modernize TASCs by triangulation of data with stakeholder benefits. Overall, this study provides a structured roadmap for digitalizing the TASCs in developing economies, laying the foundation towards digital transformation and agricultural sustainability. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Amid the rapid evolution of the digital economy and ongoing shifts in technological paradigms, how firms leverage digital transformation to effectively expand their innovation boundaries has become a key topic in strategic management and innovation research. Using panel data of listed firms in China from 2009 to 2022, this study systematically investigates the impact of digital transformation on firms' innovation boundaries and identifies the underlying transmission mechanism through the lens of supply chain collaboration. The empirical findings reveal three main insights. First, digital transformation significantly broadens firms' innovation boundaries by enhancing the cross-domain scope of their technological portfolios. This result remains robust across multiple model specifications and sensitivity checks. Second, supply chain concentration plays a critical mediating role, as digital transformation indirectly drives innovation boundary expansion by strengthening firms’ collaborative linkages with key customers and suppliers. Third, heterogeneity analyses show that this effect is more pronounced among small and medium-sized enterprises, technology-intensive firms, manufacturing firms, and those located in eastern China. This study contributes to the literature by expanding the analytical framework linking digital transformation and innovation, emphasizing the importance of supply chain structure as a key transmission channel. It also enriches the theoretical understanding of knowledge coordination and organizational boundary reconstruction in the digital era. The findings have important implications for promoting enterprise-level digital upgrading, enhancing collaborative innovation along industrial chains, and optimizing region-specific digital policy design. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: Given significant barriers to transplant access and suboptimal post-transplant outcomes, particularly for underserved populations, this review provides a summary of the studies assessing technology-enabled tools for remote patient monitoring (RPM) and education to improve kidney transplant knowledge, access, and care. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative research, we examine how digital health interventions enhance transplant knowledge, adherence, and long-term outcomes while providing recommendations for their effective design and integration into transplant care. Recent Findings: Studies demonstrate that technology-enabled interventions, including mobile health applications and personalized educational platforms complemented by provider’s support, improve transplant knowledge, adherence to immunosuppressive therapy, and blood pressure management. Programs also incorporating socio-economic support have been effective in improving transplant knowledge and progression toward transplant among African American and Hispanic patients. Patients value features such as personalized reminders, user-friendly interfaces, and storytelling platforms. However, challenges such as privacy concerns, technology access, and usability remain. Ensuring a patient-centered, culturally, and socioeconomically sensitive approach—while integrating a holistic, multi-level framework that involves patients, caregivers, donors, and healthcare providers and addresses educational, clinical, mental, and social needs—can enhance engagement and health outcomes. Emerging interventions, including wearable biosensors, chatbot-assisted education, artificial intelligence for risk prediction, and remote patient-reported outcome platforms, are expanding transplant care possibilities but require further evaluation, scalability, and centralized integration. Summary: Technology-enabled tools offer promising opportunities to address key challenges in kidney transplant care. Future research should focus on scaling, integrating, and optimizing these interventions within a Human Technology Co-Care model, combining digital innovation with provider engagement to ensure equitable, efficient, and patient-centered care. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Industries across the globe are making arduous efforts to mitigate emissions and use greener ways of transporting goods and delivering services. The supply chain includes all the activities which involve producing, transporting, and distributing goods and services, contributing to a major portion of worldwide emissions. Road transport contributes majorly to emissions; therefore, focusing on net-zero supply chains (NZSCs) is imperative. Yet, there are several challenges in the net-zero supply chain adoption pathway. Hence, in the presented study, the Technology, Organizational, and Environment and Technology Acceptance Model integrated framework determined behavioral intentions toward adopting NZSCs. The questionnaire was developed, and 206 responses were collected. Structural Equation Modeling was used to assess the proposed research model. Various constructs analyzed under the Technology, Organizational, and Environment framework were green modes of transportation (GMT), lean green integrated digital innovations (LGDI), Management Support (MS), Organizational Competency (OC), Industry Partnership and Collaborations (IPC), and Government Rules and Regulations (GRR). Similarly, perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) constructs were analyzed under the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Moreover, the mediation analysis of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use constructs was analyzed between distinct constructs and intention to adopt NZSCs. Government Rules and Regulations are found to have a strong role in mitigating environmental pollution and achieving sustainable development goals. Also, green modes of transportation do not have significant relationship between perceived usefulness. Likewise, relationship between organizational culture and perceived ease of use does not hold. © 2025 The Author(s)},

In recent years, disruptive events such as economic crises, environmental challenges, and technological advancements have profoundly reshaped the dynamics of seaports and port towns. Port cities represent complex ecosystems that integrate logistical, economic, and social activities, acting as critical nodes in the global trade network. The process of leveraging internal and external knowledge, alliances, and partnerships to accelerate innovation and improve problem-solving capabilities is known as open innovation. Conversely, innovation ecosystems describe linked networks of stakeholders—including businesses, governments, academia, and civil society—that cooperate to drive technical innovations and sustainable solutions. Both approaches are practical approaches to address complex challenges, encouraging collaboration and co-creation of solutions. However, their application in port cities and their influence on organisational and urban resilience require further investigation. Through a semi-systematic literature review, this study identifies key trends, challenges and opportunities associated with open innovation and innovation ecosystem, highlighting their potential to enhance resilience in port city contexts. Findings suggest that structured and inclusive collaboration significantly enhances urban and organisational adaptability, particularly in response to climate change and digital transformation pressures.

	abstract = {The rapid digital transformation of the sports industry has opened up unprecedented opportunities for efficiency, transparency, and innovation. Traditional transaction models still suffer from significant challenges, including centralized control, lack of trust, and inefficiencies in revenue distribution. These issues often stem from reliance on intermediaries that introduce risks such as data manipulation, high operational costs, and delays in processing financial transactions. Blockchain technology presents a promising solution by enabling decentralized, secure, and transparent transactions, fostering greater trust among all stakeholders within the sports ecosystem. Existing approaches to digital transactions in the sports industry primarily depend on centralized financial institutions and third-party service providers, which not only limit transparency but also create barriers to financial inclusivity for athletes, clubs, sponsors, and fans. To address these critical limitations, we propose a blockchain-based digital transaction model that leverages smart contracts and distributed ledger technology (DLT) to enhance the efficiency, security, and fairness of transactions across the entire sports industry value chain. Our model integrates key economic principles with advanced network analysis to optimize revenue distribution, mitigate fraudulent activities, and enable real-time transaction verification. Through extensive simulations and empirical analysis, our results demonstrate a significant improvement in transaction speed, cost reduction, and overall transparency compared to conventional models. By decentralizing financial transactions, the proposed approach not only enhances financial inclusivity for all participants but also aligns with the broader vision of sustainable and equitable growth in the digital sports economy. © The Author(s) 2025.},

To encourage SMEs to take up digital technologies, the Government of India has been creating an environment that encourages such moves by launching several initiatives including Digital India, Make in India and Startup India. This paper studies the role of stakeholder involvement in digital transformation in Indian food SMEs. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used on survey responses from 103 food SMEs using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). From the findings, there is a close relationship between stakeholder involvement and technological advancement (β = 0.595, p < 0.001) and organizational and political factors (β = 0.709, p < 0.001) as viewed by leadership, which reflects multidimensional factors leading to digital adoption. However, stakeholder involvement does not have any significant effect on financial factors (β = 0.018, p = 0.87), financial constraints being a major barrier to transformation. Moreover, although technological advancement results in a positive effect towards digital transformation (β = 0.694, p < 0.001), organizational and financial challenges act as stumbling blocks altogether. In the case of managers, this study indicates proactive involvement of stakeholders, investment in employees upskilling and alignment of organizational goals with digital initiatives for the support of technology adoption. This information assists decision makers in estimating government incentives and public private partnerships to overcome financial constraints. Digital transformation for food sector SMEs depends on a coordinated support of stakeholders, policy and technological readiness as preconditions for long term competitiveness. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The symbiotic evolution of stakeholders within digital innovation ecosystems (DIES) is crucial for achieving ecological sustainability. Thus, we integrate the Lotka-Volterra symbiotic evolution model into digital DIES research by constructing both three-actor and four-actor dynamic interaction frameworks and simulating multiple symbiotic evolution scenarios. This study indicates that: (1) The principal actors in DIES are core digital enterprises, innovation partners, digital product users, and digital platforms, with their interdependencies governed by symbiotic coefficients. (2) Introducing the digital platform into the four-actor symbiotic model significantly increases the system’s maximum carrying capacity and equilibrium scale. Parasitic symbiosis and commensal symbiosis may temporarily enhance individual actors’ competitiveness, but they undermine the overall stability of cooperation, whereas mutually beneficial symbiosis provides the optimal pattern for system evolution. (3) Building on these insights, we propose a governance framework centered on resource balancing, value sharing, and trust cooperation, and demonstrate its practical applicability through an Alibaba Cloud case study. This work not only broadens the scope of symbiosis theory within a digital-economy context but also provides actionable guidance for designing efficient, resilient DIES. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: The healthcare sector is undergoing a digital transformation, where the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a vital role in reshaping healthcare practices. AI technologies promise to improve work procedures, mitigate future risks, and expedite proactive patient care. This guide seeks to address the significant knowledge gap among healthcare professionals, focusing on AI’s integration within healthcare systems and its impact on patient safety culture. Methods: A descriptive correlational design was implemented to explore the correlations between healthcare providers’ knowledge and attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and their perception of patient safety culture. A non-probability, convenient sample of 238 healthcare providers comprising physicians, nurses, and technicians working at Najran University Hospital was included in the study. Data collection was conducted using two self-reported questionnaires: the Structured Knowledge and Attitude Questionnaire on Artificial Intelligence and the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC). Results: The research findings indicated that the healthcare providers’ knowledge and attitude toward AI are significant predictors of patient safety culture, with a combined explanatory power of 60% (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.60). Both knowledge (B = 0.296, p =.000) and attitude (B = 0.502, p =.000) show significant positive relationships with patient safety culture, indicating that higher knowledge and a more positive attitude toward AI contribute to a stronger patient safety culture. Conclusions: This study's findings emphasize the need to enhance healthcare providers’ knowledge and attitudes toward AI to reinforce a culture of patient safety. Healthcare institutions are encouraged to incorporate AI-centered education and training programs to enhance providers’ comprehension and confidence in leveraging AI for safer clinical practice. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: Digital innovations have the potential to enhance equitable access to health systems, improve care integration and support learning health systems. Research funders make substantial investments in digital health research to advance the uptake of evidence-informed digital solutions within health systems, yet their impacts on health and health system outcomes, health equity, policy and practice remain poorly understood. Research impact assessments (RIAs) serve as a vital tool for funders to examine the links between research investments and real-world change. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research commissioned an RIA on its largest digital health program, the eHealth Innovations Partnership Program (eHIPP), to understand the program’s outputs and impacts. Methods: This study applied two complementary frameworks, the Canadian Academy of Heath Science’s (CAHS) Making an Impact Framework and the Canadian Health Services and Policy Research Alliance’s (CHSPRA) Informing Decision-Making Framework, to assess the research impact of the eHIPP program, funded from 2015 to 2021. A mixed-methods approach was taken to collect and analyse data from eHIPP grant recipients and their partners. Results: The eHIPP program supported 22 research teams through a total investment of CAD$ 42M. The RIA revealed impacts in the areas of capacity development, knowledge creation, informing decision-making and health outcomes. The teams generated 36 co-designed, evidenced-informed solutions, 79 publications, 194 presentations and 38 media interviews or articles. Solutions were reported to influence health system practice (52%) and policy (33%), improve health outcomes (62%), enhance equitable access to care (62%), improve patient (62%) and provider experience (52%), increase cost-effectiveness (52%), enhance population health (48%) and improve health equity (43%). Conclusions: This RIA study highlights the importance of stakeholder collaboration, robust partnerships and co-design approaches in effectively integrating patient-centred digital health solutions into health systems. These elements are key to advancing the Quintuple Aim (improved cost, population health and equity and experience of patients and providers) and supporting evidence-informed decisions. This paper presents a first case study applying the CAHS and CHSPRA frameworks to assess the impacts of a large digital health funding program. Further, it explores the program’s outcomes and impacts and highlights considerations, successes and challenges for funders when applying RIA. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Although e-commerce is growing rapidly among consumers, its technological space is still primarily dominated by large enterprises, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in emerging markets struggling to keep pace. In Indonesia and Malaysia, e-commerce adoption among SMEs remains limited, highlighting the critical need to understand factors that facilitate or hinder digital transformation. This study addresses this gap by developing and testing an integrative model that combines the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, innovation resistance theory (IRT), and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Survey data collected from 357 SMEs were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results show that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and organizational readiness significantly enhance adoption intention, while effort expectancy, social factors, and technological context do not exert a meaningful effect. Among the barriers, value, usage, risk, and image concerns negatively impact adoption, whereas traditional barriers were not statistically supported. Notably, value barriers emerged as the most substantial deterrent, while facilitating conditions and organizational readiness were the most influential enablers. The integrated model explains 89.9% of the variance in e-commerce adoption intention, indicating a strong explanatory power. These findings suggest that improving digital infrastructure, building organizational capabilities, and addressing perceived value and usability concerns are critical for boosting SME participation in e-commerce. Policy and managerial implications include the importance of customized government initiatives, ecosystem support from platform providers, and targeted awareness programs to reduce perceived risks and increase digital engagement among SMEs. This study contributes to the e-commerce literature by offering a comprehensive framework for understanding adoption behavior and providing evidence-based recommendations for accelerating SME digital transformation in emerging markets. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation (DT) is complex and uncertain, particularly within traditional industries. Distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain, has driven DT across many global sectors. Despite its transformative potential, scaling blockchain solutions beyond pilot projects often fails due to technical, organisational and environmental barriers. Many failures stem from ineffective collaboration and strategic misalignment among ecosystem partners rather than from technology. This study examines collaborative processes and enabling capabilities required for successful DT by focusing on a longitudinal case study from Finland (2019–2023). The case follows a cross-industry, blockchain-driven DT initiative that achieved scale despite transitioning from private blockchain to centralised technologies after market entry. While the role of blockchain in this success has been documented (Saari et al., 2024), the ecosystem collaboration mechanisms and strategies for tackling challenges remain unclear. Using the technology–organisation–environment (TOE) framework, this paper analyses how DT unfolded across these contexts, identifying best practice strategies and enabling capabilities. The study draws on 35 interviews with key stakeholders and thematic content analysis to identify critical scaling enablers. Our findings reveal that scaling blockchain-driven DT in cross-industry settings requires 1) industry-level mindset and shared vision, 2) formalised collaboration and public–private partnerships, 3) governance structure with a sustainable business model and funding, 4) complementary ecosystem roles and an early-stage champion, 5) stakeholder training and support and 6) flexibility in technology and agile implementation. These elements show that trust and strategic alignment can emerge even among direct competitors, offering valuable insights for enterprises exploring blockchain innovation in business-to-business contexts. © 2025 The Authors},

Still, its implementation has been challenged by barriers to technological, organizational, and societal dimensions. The current study utilizes the Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Fuzzy DEMATEL) technique to comprehensively identify and assess the interconnections among fundamental IoT integration challenges. Thirteen crucial components were analysed, influencing interoperability challenges, data security and privacy issues, standardized issues, high initial investment, scaling obstacles, and adverse environmental effects. The results indicate a clear differentiation between seven cause variables such as lack of skilled workforce, interoperability issues, standardization gaps, high initial investment, regulatory issues, resistance to change, and data security and privacy issues were the most influential challenges and six effects (dependent) factors including vendor dependency risks were the most impacted effect factors. These findings highlight the necessity to tackle fundamental problems, including standardization, workforce development, and regulatory clarity. This research strengthens theoretical aspects in IoT using Fuzzy DEMATEL by delivering a robust decision-making roadmap. The results highlights actionable practical recommendations for regulators and businesses for effective resource utilization to improve their IoT adoption in compliance with sustainable development. Businesses can utilize the full potential of IoT by addressing such problems and promote innovative environment to ensure a sustainable and resilient future. © 2025 The Authors},

They either create fragmented identities tied to specific online services, making it difficult for users to manage, or they raise concerns about being locked into corporate identity providers and data protection issues. Additionally, they provide limited support for machine-verifiable identity attributes. This reliance on third parties for managing machine identities can put companies at a market disadvantage. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a unified identity management solution that allows for the portable and interoperable use of verifiable identity data across services. The recently announced European Digital Identity Wallet marks a significant step forward in digital identity management. This initiative aims to provide EU citizens with a unified, secure, and convenient way to access both public and private online services, thereby enhancing the efficiency and security of digital interactions and prioritizing user needs. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) forms the basis for such a wallet-based identity ecosystem that supports electronic market growth.

	abstract = {Even with the availability of modelling languages such as 4EM and ArchiMate, a noticeable uncertainty persists among professionals regarding the efficient development of process models in the software ecosystem. While current enterprise modelling frameworks and guidelines provide valuable perspectives on essential quality aspects, they are usually more abstract to apply in real-world scenarios directly. This study compares the features of 4EM and ArchiMate, underlining their distinct characteristics for a specific context of software outsourcing. Further, this paper demonstrates a choice of appropriate views of these two modelling languages to model a decision-making scenario for software vendor analysis and selection. Thus, this research supports software enterprises to understand their business processes related explicitly to outsourcing and benefits company personnel involved in decision-making. In addition to model development, 4EM and ArchiMate are tested for the extent they fit for modelling the given decision-making context in the software ecosystem. It is observed that ArchiMate is better suited to the given context. Afterwards, the models are validated using the SEQUAL framework which resulted in identification and incorporation of a new process activity in ‘As-Is’ scenario. This further provided means for digital innovation for ‘To-Be’ scenario of enterprise business process. However, the models developed in this study are premature since they are validated with a theoretical framework only, and the involvement of experts is limited. Thus, more validation studies are required in actual settings with more experts to improve the models further. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Omnichannel retailing enables retailers to address challenges from digital transformation and the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding what motivates customers to stick with an omnichannel retailer and make repeat purchases is critical. While existing research has primarily focused on retailer-centric perspectives and seamless customer experiences, customer-centric factors—such as omnichannel synergy, defined as the added value created by integrating multiple channels and resources—remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap by integrating the dedication-constraint (DC) model with key contextual factors, including omnichannel synergy and transaction costs, to examine customer post-adoption decisions, specifically omnichannel stickiness and repurchase intention. The DC model elucidates how dedication mechanisms (desire for long-term relationships, reflected in omnichannel synergy and customer-brand engagement [CBE]) and constraint mechanisms (past investments and benefits, reflected in seamless experience [SE], transaction costs, and calculative attachment) influence customer behavior. Based on a quantitative survey of 802 omnichannel users, supplemented by in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, the findings reveal that (1) dedication and constraint mechanisms explain 74% of the variance in customer stickiness and 69% in repurchase intention, (2) omnichannel synergy accounts for 61% of CBE variance, and (3) SE and transaction cost-savings explain 41% of calculative attachment. This study shifts the focus of omnichannel research from traditional retailer-centered metrics to customer-centered perspectives, offering a cross-disciplinary model that underscores the pivotal role of omnichannel synergy in shaping post-adoption behaviors. Retailers are advised to invest in the four pillars of omnichannel synergy—horizontal, vertical, strategic, and financial—to strengthen customer retention and drive repeat purchases through integrated channels, strategic partnerships, and cost efficiencies. © The Author(s) 2025.},

Digital education Technologies (DETs) have become integral to higher education, reshaping how institutions deliver learning and manage resources. However, despite the widespread adoption of DETs, there has been limited focus on the sustainability of these technologies. This paper explores how sustainability considerations are integrated into DET selection processes at European Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through semi-structured interviews with key decision-makers. The research focuses on three sustainability dimensions-environmental, social, and technological-and their impact on decision-making. The results indicate that while HEIs are making efforts toward sustainability, economic considerations still dominate the decision-making process. Moreover, the emphasis across sustainability dimensions remains unbalanced: social dimensions, such as privacy, are prioritized over environmental dimensions due to the former being treated as knockout criteria and due to a lack of reliable data on the environmental impacts of DETs. This study also identifies several challenges, including long procurement processes, limited financial resources, and heavy dependence on external service providers for digital infrastructure. The findings offer insights into how HEIs can better align their digital strategies with broader sustainability goals. © The Author(s) 2025.},

There are many ways to help move towards sustainable livestock farming. The primary methods in major Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries are regulation, economic incentives, and supportive measures. The most important tools are regulation and financial support. This study looked at the effec-tiveness of these tools, the role of government in supporting sustainable livestock, and ways to improve these policies. It also discussed using smart technology for sustainable farming, introducing a certification system for sustainable livestock products, increasing public interest and willingness to pay for sustainable products, training future experts, and creating partnerships between the public and private sectors. The study concluded that ef-fective policy implementation requires a combination of regulation and support. Necessary regulations should be applied with enough time and agreement from society, even if the livestock industry opposes. Support policies are currently scattered and not well-connect-ed, so they need to be comprehensively linked to sustainable livestock farming. It is important to have a consistent policy system that sets measurable goals, provides budget support, and evaluates performance step by step to achieve the goal of sustainable livestock farming in South Korea. © 2025 by Animal Bioscience.},

In this review, we examine the contributions of public health, dermatology, behavioural science, and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and bioinformatics, which have collectively shaped prevention in recent decades. Methods: Using a narrative scoping review approach guided by the PRISMA-ScR framework, we synthesised research across these disciplines to highlight their roles in enhancing skin cancer prevention. Results: Initial efforts focused on increasing public knowledge through sun protection campaigns and symptom recognition. Dermatologists enhanced early detection through refined techniques and clinical guidelines. Initiatives such as Euromelanoma enabled broader collaboration and population-level screening. As more disciplines joined, advances in risk stratification, digital imaging, artificial intelligence, molecular and genetic diagnostics and bioinformatics became possible. Beyond skin cancer prevention, these tools may have additional applications for systemic health issues. However, a number of challenges remain, particularly regarding data privacy concerns, cost-effectiveness, equitable access, and the validation of artificial intelligence tools in diverse populations. Conclusions: The prevention of skin cancer brings together knowledge spanning the fields of public health and dermatology to behavioural research and digital innovation. Working together, these disciplines have improved early detection and awareness. However, fragmented collaboration across regions throughout the world continue to limit their impact. Improved equity alongside stronger, more coordinated partnerships will be essential for the next phase of progress. © 2025 by the authors.},

This article examines how EU member states modify their VET systems to address evolving labor market demands and align with the objectives of SDGs 4, 8, and 10, utilizing system alignment, decentralization, infrastructure development, stakeholder engagement, and investment in green and digital skills. The article analyzed the influence of these five strategies. Using cross-national comparative analysis and multidimensional indicators, the study reveals that strong partnerships with labor market stakeholders and investments in green and digital transitions significantly enhance the responsiveness and sustainability of VET systems. However, assumptions related to the decentralization of governance and infrastructure expansion were not consistently supported, indicating the need for a more nuanced approach to policy reform. The findings offer practical implications for VET policy design, emphasizing flexibility, system coherence, and future-oriented planning. This study contributes to the growing body of research that links education systems to sustainable economic development.

	abstract = {Background/Objectives: With digital transformation, patient portals and phone consultations are increasingly integrated into hybrid primary care workflows that combine in-person and remote services. This study aimed to assess the acceptability of these tools among patients and identify factors associated with acceptability. Methods: Between April and June 2025, a multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted in four primary healthcare centers in Slovenia. The sample included 214 people who had used both patient portals and phone consultations within the previous 12 months. Data collected covered socio-demographic and clinical profile, digital communication skills, quality of life, and annual use of digital tools. Acceptability was assessed using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) tool. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with acceptability. Results: Among the 214 participants (mean age 42.9 ± 14.1 years; 61.2% female), both patient portals and phone consultations were generally acceptable, with similar overall TFA scores (3.9/5). Patient portals were considered as significantly less time-consuming and better for communication, whereas phone consultations were preferred for accessibility and reliability. Multivariable analyses showed that higher digital communication skills and better quality of life predicted greater acceptability for both methods, whereas lower education level and more frequent use were associated with higher acceptability of phone consultations. Conclusions: Acceptability of patient portals and phone consultations varies by education, digital communication skills, and quality of life. This highlights the need for personalized hybrid care solutions. Healthcare providers should offer flexible digital options, invest in digital literacy programs, and develop interoperable eHealth infrastructure to enable safe and sustainable integration of advanced tools such as video consultations. © 2025 by the authors.},

Yet, its workforce development remains underexplored in public health and health policy research. Objective: To develop a role-based model of innovation procurement capacity in health and care, identifying emerging roles and associated competencies needed within complex public health systems. Methods: We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with procurement professionals from five European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain). Guided by the Dynamic Capabilities framework, thematic analysis identified role-based patterns in innovation procurement. Competency profiles were mapped against the European Commission's ProcurComp<sup>EU</sup> framework. Results: Six emerging roles were identified: Strategic Business Partner, Digital/Automation Expert, Innovation Matchmaker, Sustainability Coordinator, Data Engineer, and Innovation Coordinator. These roles signal a shift from generalist procurement functions to specialised, distributed innovation capacities. The analysis extends the ProcurComp<sup>EU</sup> framework with sector-specific, innovation-oriented competencies. Conclusions: Building procurement competencies in the health and care workforce is essential for harnessing innovation in service delivery. This study offers a framework for competency development and highlights the institutional conditions required for effective application. Innovation procurement demands differentiated roles and capabilities aligned with system-wide goals for resilience, digital transformation, and sustainability. The proposed role-based model serves as a practical roadmap for policymakers, public institutions, and training providers to professionalise the procurement workforce and position it as a strategic enabler of health and care transformation. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study evaluates Egypt’s Integrated Urban Emergency Response System (UERS), a national initiative developed through a strategic partnership between the Ministry of Local Development and the National Network for Emergency Services and Public Safety. Framed within Egypt Vision 2030 and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the research addresses a central question: To what extent has the UERS improved operational effectiveness, institutional coordination, and equitable access to emergency services in Egyptian cities? The study aims to evaluate the system's effectiveness in reducing emergency response times and assesses the role of advanced technologies, like artificial intelligence (AI), geographic information systems (GIS), and 5 Generation (5G) infrastructure, in enhancing real-time decision-making and crisis detection. It further examines the degree of institutional integration among emergency service providers, analyzes the fair access to emergency services across diverse urban populations, and explores the system’s overall contribution to strengthening urban resilience. The study addresses persistent challenges in Egypt’s emergency governance most notably the unequal distribution of services, institutional fragmentation, and limited technological capacity in peripheral regions such as South Sinai. The research aims to assess whether UERS has improved emergency response times, enhanced inter-agency coordination, expanded the use of advanced technologies (AI, GIS, 5G), ensured equitable access to services, and demonstrated potential for replication in comparable urban settings. A mixed-methods research design is adopted, combining qualitative policy and case analysis, key informant interviews, geospatial mapping, and quantitative assessment of pre-and post-implementation performance indicators. Data are collected from national policy frameworks, technical reports, GIS maps, and field observations in South Sinai Governorate. The study tests a series of hypotheses to evaluate the performance and impact of UERS. It posits that the system has significantly enhanced coordination among agencies and reduced emergency response times, while also identifying critical challenges such as shortages in trained human resources and initial resistance from decision-makers that have constrained full implementation. Additional hypotheses explore the contribution of advanced technologies to improving situational awareness and operational efficiency, how the system ensures fair access to emergency services across different urban populations, the role of decentralized governance in strengthening inter-agency collaboration, and the feasibility of replicating the Egyptian model in similar urban countries. Findings mention that while technological innovation and governance reforms have enhanced crisis response capabilities, institutional capacity gaps and uneven service distribution, particularly in informal settlements, remain persistent challenges. This study’s comprehensive SWOT analysis and results framework underscore the need for sustained political commitment, continuous technological adaptation, and robust stakeholder collaboration to fully realize the UERS's potential in fostering resilient urban environments. The study concludes that Egypt’s model offers a promising and adaptable framework for urban emergency management in developing regions, provided investments in human capital and political commitment are sustained alongside digital modernization. © 2025, Assiut University, Faculty of Engineering.

	abstract = {This study develops a two‑stage, game‑theoretic model to analyse how payment term and liquidity risks affect small and medium‑sized enterprises (SMEs) in supply chain finance (SCF). The model simulates a purchase order financing (POF) setting in which suppliers face uncertain payment delays and liquidity constraints, which we model using exponential and Poisson distributions, respectively. Building on this foundation, we evaluate two emerging digital SCF solutions, factoring with smart contracts (FSC) and online invoice trading (OIT), and benchmark them against traditional order‑to‑factoring (OTF). Our model captures strategic interactions between suppliers and retailers under varying risk conditions. The results show that FSC effectively mitigates payment term risk and enables both suppliers and retailers to achieve higher profits than under POF. Moreover, FSC outperforms OTF when the liquidity risk discount exceeds the premium charged for factoring. OIT, which simultaneously addresses both payment term and liquidity risks, consistently delivers the highest value, especially in high liquidity risk environments. While liquidity risk reduces the relative benefit of FSC, it increases the value proposition of OIT. Furthermore, the benefit of mitigating payment term risk initially increases for both FSC and OIT, but this effect tapers off as risk intensity grows. These findings offer practical guidance for SMEs selecting financing strategies under uncertainty, for financial institutions designing responsive SCF products, and for policymakers seeking to narrow the SME credit gap through digital innovation. © 2025},

The results show that customer digitalization significantly increases supplier cash flow volatility: a one-standard-deviation increase in customer digital transformation leads to a 0.291-standard–deviation increase in volatility. Asymmetry tests show that the effect is significant only when the customer firm is larger than the supplier or when the supplier relationship is unstable. We identify two plausible mechanisms underlying this effect: digital spillover and supply‒demand mismatch.

	abstract = {During the Covid-19 pandemic, tech startups emerged as important providers of pandemic intelligence, leveraging diverse data sources and advanced computational methods to advise public policy on disease spread and response strategies. This article presents a case study of two tech startups, Airfinity and BlueDot, situating their rise within the increasing private-sector influence in a domain traditionally dominated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its national public health agencies. It examines how these firms established epistemic authority through the integration of proprietary data, artificial intelligence and novel expertise, enhancing their scientific credibility and gaining access to key global and national policy arenas and public-sector contracts. The article discusses how the emergence of a commercial market for pandemic intelligence dilutes the WHO's authority within global disease surveillance and raises concerns about outsourcing essential public health insights to the private sector. Further, it explores how the business of pandemic intelligence transforms public health data into commercial products, challenging norms that posit equity and public purpose as basis for the digital transformation of the public health sphere. This analysis contributes to ongoing debates about the technology sector's expanding influence over public health and policy, highlighting the growing role of private power in global governance. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Research on open innovation (OI) in SMEs, particularly in the context of digital innovations and big data (BD), often highlights the potential for these innovations to drive SME growth. While digital innovations and BD can indeed enhance OI practices by presenting new opportunities, there is a significant gap in understanding how the challenges posed by these innovations can also act as catalysts for OI in SMEs. This study addresses this gap by examining the challenges faced by SMEs when leveraging digital innovations and BD for service delivery in the agri-food sector, and how they address them through OI practices. Focusing on Agritech firms in Ghana's agri-food sector as an empirical case, we conducted qualitative exploratory research using interviews and secondary data to fill the research gap. Our findings showcase how Agritech firms adopt OI practices through strategic collaborations and partnerships with external organizations interested in agricultural interventions which was triggered by the challenges they faced in leveraging digital innovations and BD. These partnerships and collaborations also serve as anticipatory measures to tackle potential future challenges. Our findings are not only applicable to Agritech firms in the agri-food sector but also offer valuable insights for other SMEs with limited financial resources and portfolio diversification in other sectors for anticipating related challenges. © 2025 The Author(s).

Using firm-level panel data from 2020 to 2022, sourced from the China National Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, corporate sustainability disclosures and patent databases, we employ a dynamic panel model estimated via the generalised method of moments (GMM) to address endogeneity concerns. The findings reveal that environmental innovation significantly enhances sustainability performance by reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency and optimising waste management. However, digital integration alone shows a negative impact, suggesting that its benefits may not inherently align with environmental objectives. Notably, the interaction between environmental innovation and digital integration demonstrates a synergistic effect, where digital tools enhance the effectiveness of green innovations. Policy support further strengthens this relationship, highlighting the importance of subsidies, tax incentives and regulatory measures in driving sustainability. These insights provide valuable guidance for policymakers and industry stakeholders to align digital transformation with environmental goals, ensuring long-term sustainability in resource-intensive industries.

	abstract = {Distance education (DE) has become a core component of higher education institutions, particularly in response to rapid digital transformation and global sustainability goals. In this perspective, identifying sustainability dimensions, understanding stakeholder roles, and the interrelationships between them are essential for the long-term success of DE. This study addresses the research gap concerning the stakeholder-driven sustainability of DE by proposing a novel hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. This approach, which integrates factor analysis (FA) and the Matrix of Alliances and Conflicts: Tactics, Objectives and Recommendations (MACTOR) method enhanced with circular intuitionistic fuzzy sets (C-IFSs), explores stakeholder interrelationships and their impact on sustainability factors. Based on survey data collected from 92 higher education institutions, five sustainability factors were extracted. Using the C-IFS-enhanced MACTOR method, the impact and roles of nine stakeholders on the sustainability factors are obtained, addressing the uncertainty in assessments. The findings indicate that institutional factors are the most important, followed by environmental-economic and pedagogical-psychological factors. Managerial staff, higher education institutions, and accreditation bodies lead institutional sustainability; administrative staff and service providers underpin environmental-economic sustainability; and students and academic staff drive pedagogical-psychological sustainability. To validate the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach, sensitivity and comparative analyses are conducted. The proposed approach contributes to stakeholder analysis under uncertainty and offers practical insights for decision-makers involved in the sustainable implementation of DE. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the context of a global business environment marked by volatility and uncertainty, enhancing the resilience of supply chains in high-end manufacturing has become both an urgent necessity and a complex challenge. This study focuses on how digital transformation can improve supply chain resilience (SCR) in high-end manufacturing enterprises. Based on panel data from 2,434 A-share listed high-end manufacturing firms in mainland China from 2014 to 2023, the study constructs and applies Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) - a path modeling approach under the machine learning paradigm - to systematically analyze the mechanisms and causal pathways through which digital transformation influences resilience. Bootstrap resampling is also introduced to verify the robustness of the mediation effects. The empirical results indicate that digital transformation has a significant positive impact on supply chain resilience, primarily through two key mediating pathways: (1) optimizing supply-demand alignment and (2) enhancing suppliers' innovation capability. Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of digital transformation on SCR is more pronounced in small and medium-sized enterprises and state-owned enterprises, which may be attributed to differences in resource endowments and policy support. These findings not only enrich the theoretical understanding of supply chain resilience in the digital era but also provide empirical support for high-end manufacturing firms to design differentiated digital strategies and strengthen their ability to cope with external disruptions. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Subsequently, a total of 645 respondent data were processed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) method with the assistance of SmartPLS 4.0 software. Results: The male and female respondents stated that cash waqf literacy did not influence trust and behavioral intention. However, perceived ease of e-cash waqf significantly impacted both trust and behavioral intention. Majority of the male respondents reported that religiosity, and trust in nazhir had a significant impact. Both genders stated that religiosity did not moderate the relationship between the variables. Conclusion: In conclusion, the importance of technological ease of use and religiosity in influencing trust and intention to contribute to digital cash waqf was analyzed. Based on this perspective, both variables impacted trust and behavioral intention. The female respondents perceived trust as an insignificant factor, and recommended nazhir institutions partnered with financial technology (fintech) companies to develop user-friendly platforms. This included the engagement of female donors through religious education.

	abstract = {Background: The digitalization of medical services is promoted as a solution for improving access, quality, and efficiency within healthcare systems. In this context, the study investigates the extent to which digitalization in Romania meets the current needs of patients through a convergent analysis of user perceptions and managerial perspectives. Based on the specialized literature, the research tests two hypotheses: (H1) the implementation of digital technologies significantly contributes to improving the quality of medical services and operational efficiency; (H2) digitalization has a positive impact on patient satisfaction by facilitating access to care and improving communication with medical personnel. Methods: The study adopted methodology is cross-sectional and mixed, including an online mixed-methods questionnaire for patients, distributed between 6 and 14 May 2025, and a qualitative questionnaire with open-ended questions distributed via e-mail to managers from public hospitals through The Administration of Hospitals and Medical Services of Bucharest, between 3 and 24 March 2025. Results: In total, 125 patients and 15 hospital managers participated in the study. Statistical analysis (χ<sup>2</sup>, ordinal regression) and data triangulation highlight a predominantly positive, yet heterogeneous, patient perception of digitalization, with Hypothesis H1 only partially supported (weak, inconsistent, and in some cases negative associations between technology use and perceived service quality). By contrast, H2 was robustly validated, with patient satisfaction strongly linked to tangible benefits, particularly easier access and online appointment scheduling. However, use remains limited to administrative functions, while advanced technologies such as telemedicine or electronic health records are poorly adopted. From an institutional perspective, hospitals predominantly use IT systems for internal purposes, without real patient access to their own data, no interoperability between medical units, and marginal implementation of telemedicine. This reveals a significant gap between user perception and organizational realities, emphasizing the lack of a patient-oriented digital infrastructure. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential of digitalization to enhance patient experience and service efficiency, while also pointing out structural limitations that hinder the full realization of this potential. Patient satisfaction is strongly associated with tangible benefits, particularly easier access and online scheduling, whereas the effect on perceived quality is weaker and sometimes inconsistent. There are significant disparities in digitalization levels between healthcare providers, perceived by patients as public–private differences, and gaps among public hospitals are also confirmed by managerial data. These findings suggest that a successful digital transformation of the medical system in Romania must address both technological infrastructure gaps and organizational barriers, within a coordinated national strategy that ensures interoperability, patient-centered design, and sustainable implementation. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and smart technologies is reshaping global hospitality. However, in emerging markets, uptake remains limited by financial, organizational, and infrastructural barriers. This study examines the digital readiness of 1821 licensed accommodation providers in Albania, a rapidly expanding tourism economy, using an integrated framework that combines the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework, and Diffusion of Innovations (DOI). Data were collected via a structured survey and analyzed using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis, and structural equation modeling. Exploratory factor analysis identified a single robust readiness dimension, covering smart automation, environmental controls, and AI-driven systems. K-means segmentation revealed three adopter profiles: Tech Leaders (17.7%), Selective Adopters (43.5%), and Skeptics (38.8%), with statistically distinct but modest mean differences in readiness, reflecting stronger adoption in central urban and coastal hubs compared to weaker uptake in cultural heritage and non-urban regions. Structural modeling showed that environmental competitive pressure strongly enhanced perceived usefulness, which, in turn, drove behavioral intention, whereas perceived ease of use (operationalized as implementation complexity) had negligible effects. Innovation readiness was consistently associated with broader adoption, although intention was translated into actual use only among Tech Leaders. The findings highlight a fragmented digital ecosystem in which enthusiasm for AI exceeds its feasibility, underscoring the need for differentiated policy support, modular vendor solutions, and targeted capacity building to foster inclusive digital transformation. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Blockchain-Based Medical Insurance Transaction System (BMIT) developed in this study addresses key issues in traditional medical insurance—information silos, data tampering, and privacy breaches—through innovative blockchain architectural design and technical infrastructure reconstruction. Built on a consortium blockchain architecture with FISCO BCOS (Financial Blockchain Shenzhen Consortium Blockchain Open Source Platform) as the underlying platform, the system leverages FISCO BCOS’s distributed ledger, granular access control, and efficient consensus algorithms to enable multi-stakeholder on-chain collaboration. Four node roles and data protocols are defined: hospitals (on-chain data providers) generate 3D coordinate hashes of medical data via an algorithmically enhanced Bloom Filter for on-chain certification; patients control data access via blockchain private keys and unique parameters; insurance companies verify eligibility/claims using on-chain Bloom filters; the blockchain network stores encrypted key data (public keys, Bloom filter coordinates, and timestamps) to ensure immutability and traceability. A 3D-enhanced Bloom filter—tailored for on-chain use with user-specific hash functions and key control—stores only 3D coordinates (not raw data), cutting storage costs for 100 records to 1.27 KB and reducing the error rate to near zero ( (Formula presented.) lower than traditional schemes for 10,000 entries). Three core smart contracts (identity registration, medical information certification, and automated verification) enable the automation of on-chain processes. Performance tests conducted on a 4-node consortium chain indicate a transaction throughput of 736 TPS (Transactions Per Second) and a per-operation latency of 181.7 ms, which meets the requirements of large-scale commercial applications. BMIT’s three-layer design (“underlying blockchain + enhanced Bloom filter + smart contracts”) delivers a balanced, efficient blockchain medical insurance prototype, offering a reusable technical framework for industry digital transformation. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study explores the readiness of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) in Mexico, specifically grocery stores, to implement the Virtual Value Chain (VVC) through Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D). A mixed-methods approach was used, combining diagnostic tools, structured surveys, and interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and machine learning to identify digital adoption patterns. The results indicate that limited technology adoption remains the main obstacle to VVC integration. Significant associations were found between digital engagement and the age and educational level of store managers. Key digital gaps persist in inventory control, supplier coordination, and demand forecasting. Although machine learning models did not significantly outperform baseline predictions on willingness to adopt technology, the findings emphasize the potential of targeted training and accessible mobile solutions. The study proposes a new diagnostic and predictive framework to assess VVC readiness in low-resource contexts. It shows that ICT, when strategically aligned with business operations and paired with adequate training, can enhance sustainability and livelihoods. Although the study is limited to one geographic area and one business sector, it offers a foundation for scaling similar initiatives. The findings support context-sensitive strategies and capacity-building efforts tailored to the realities of MSEs in emerging economies. © 2025 by the authors.},

In this study, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics among four key stakeholders in the smart kitchen ecosystem: data providers, data-sharing platforms, data consumers, and regulators. We develop a four-party evolutionary game model to analyze the strategic interactions and behavioral evolution of each participant, applying replicator dynamics and Lyapunov stability theory. Our findings reveal that (1) data providers’ willingness to supply high-quality data is strongly influenced by platform incentives; (2) platforms’ adoption of data governance mechanisms depends on associated governance costs; (3) regulatory subsidies contribute significantly to system stability; and (4) increased financial support for regulators promotes favorable system evolution. This work offers both theoretical insights and practical guidance for data sharing in smart kitchens, providing a novel perspective on digital transformation within the restaurant industry. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study examines the early impact of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) implementation on the financial performance of Croatian companies, focusing on indicators of profitability, efficiency, and activity. The research investigates whether firms adopting I4.0 technologies achieve superior results compared to traditional companies. A unique feature of this study is its integration of primary data—collected via an online survey of Croatian enterprises—with secondary data from publicly available financial reports. Statistical methods, including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and linear regression, were employed to test the hypotheses. The results show that I4.0 adopters perform significantly better in terms of net profit margin, return on assets, business efficiency, and supplier bonding days, while no significant difference was found in days sales outstanding. This paper contributes to the literature by offering one of the first empirical analyses of early-stage I4.0 adoption in the context of a transition economy, using firm-level financial data. The findings provide valuable insights for managers, policymakers, and investors aiming to understand the tangible business benefits of digital transformation. The results also highlight the importance of supporting I4.0 adoption strategies to enhance competitiveness and recovery in post-pandemic economic conditions. © 2025 by the author.},

We first investigate the effect of the MPD, including both suppliers' market power discrepancy (SMPD) and customers' market power discrepancy (CMPD), on the scales of focal firms' TC. We find that the SMPD is positively correlated with the TC of focal firms, while the CMPD is negatively correlated with its TC. Further, we find that DT enhances the effect of SMPD on TC scales but weakens the effect of CMPD on TC scales. This study advances understanding of MPD's effects on TC from a paradoxical perspective of digitalization, offering practitioners insights into the impact of deploying digital technologies on supply chain relationships. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {The 7th Global Ministerial Summit on Patient Safety, convened in Manila in April 2025, advanced global efforts to reduce harm in healthcare under the theme ‘Weaving Strengths for the Future of Patient Safety’. Drawing on the metaphor of textile weaving, the Summit emphasised that safeguarding patients is a collaborative endeavour, requiring integrated action across sectors and systems. The Mandaluyong Declaration reaffirmed commitments to the WHO Global Patient Safety Action Plan (2021–2030) and made four pledges: strengthening global collaboration, advancing leadership and governance, integrating patient safety into disaster preparedness and climate resilience, and building people-centred safety systems. The mission of the International Society for Quality in Health Care (ISQua), a key presence at the Summit, is aligned with these aims, contributing through its White Paper on patient safety, its Green Paper on climate-resilient health systems, and its Person-Centred Care White Paper. The Summit marked a shift from commitment to implementation, recognising the importance of climate change, digital transformation, and equity as integral to safe care. Patient safety now stands as both a global health and environmental priority. ISQua will continue supporting this work through advocacy, standards development, and partnerships, helping to weave patient safety into the daily practice of healthcare worldwide. © The Author(s) 2025.

Using a Chinese sample from 2012 to 2022, we find that customers' digitalization effectively reduces suppliers' greenwashing. This main finding remains robust after addressing endogeneity concerns and conducting a series of robustness checks. We further reveal that customer digital transformation increases suppliers' voluntary ESG disclosure, intensifies customer-driven reputational pressure, and fosters collaborative green innovation, thereby suppressing suppliers' greenwashing behavior. Furthermore, the effect of digital governance on supply chain partners' greenwashing is more pronounced among suppliers that are highly dependent on a single customer and have limited bargaining power, as well as among customers that are subject to more stringent environmental regulations and are state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Our findings introduce customer digitalization as a novel governance mechanism for curbing upstream greenwashing and extend the understanding of how digital capabilities enhance accountability for sustainable practices across supply chains. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

In the digital era, emerging technologies offer opportunities to improve efficiency, accessibility, and sustainability. This study presents a comparative review of minibus-based paratransit in developed and developing contexts by combining a bibliometric analysis of literature published between 2016 and April 2025 with a qualitative assessment of case studies and pilot projects. The findings show that in developing countries, these systems remain largely less formal and user-driven, serving both trunk and feeder functions. In contrast, paratransit services in developed countries operate under formal regulations and employ advanced information and communication technology to serve older adults and individuals with disabilities. Building on these insights, this study proposes an integrated demand-responsive transit transferability framework for action that covers technology, service design, integration, and business model components, each supported by specific regulatory enablers and practical strategies. The framework guides policymakers, transit agencies, and technology providers in adapting digital solutions across diverse socioeconomic and infrastructural environments. Key challenges include regulatory fragmentation, gaps in digital literacy, and financing constraints. The study concludes by outlining priority research directions to improve driver certification, advance multimodal integration, and develop sustainable digital business models that balance cost effectiveness, inclusivity, and environmental objectives. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between data factor marketization (DFM) and enterprise innovation quality (EIQ) through econometric analysis. Leveraging the staggered implementation of data trading platforms across Chinese cities as a quasi-natural experiment, we employ difference-in-differences methodology on comprehensive panel data from Chinese listed companies spanning 2007–2022. Our findings demonstrate that DFM implementation significantly elevates innovation quality among affected enterprises. The conclusion remains robust across multiple specification tests, placebo analyses, and instrumental variable approaches addressing endogeneity concerns. The research illuminates four distinct mechanisms through which DFM enhances innovation: strengthening enterprise information infrastructure, alleviating financing constraints, stabilizing supplier relationships, and increasing the scale of intangible assets of enterprises. DFM has stronger promoting effects on EIQ in large cities, eastern cities, and cities with higher intellectual property protection levels, and is also more capable of enhancing innovation quality in state-owned enterprises, growth-stage enterprises, and enterprises with CEOs having information technology backgrounds. These findings advance theoretical understanding of digital transformation's role in innovation systems while offering empirical foundations for policy frameworks seeking to leverage data as a strategic production factor.

	abstract = {Against the background that only a few companies have successfully entered the international market to sell digital products, it is important to study whether the export of digital products by enterprises can bring digital technology spillover effects to upstream enterprises in the supply chain. This paper uses supply chain network data constructed by data from Chinese listed companies and customs data from 2009 to 2016. Empirical tests have found that, firstly, the export of digital products can not only promote digital innovation in enterprises, but also indirectly promote digital innovation in upstream enterprises in the supply chain. The indirect effect of the export of digital products by enterprises accounts for approximately 41.3 % of the total effect. Second, the export of digital products can promote digital innovation in upstream enterprises through knowledge and technology spillovers, digital innovation awareness spillovers, and financial spillovers. Third, the supply chain spillover effects of exports of digital products are characterized by asymmetry. The promotion effect of exports of digital products on digital innovation of upstream enterprises is stronger when the average distance between suppliers and customers is closer, the level of digital infrastructure construction in the supplier's region is higher, and the supplier's customer concentration is lower. © 2025},

	abstract = {This paper investigates how enterprise digital transformation affects the cost of debt financing from the perspective of customer concentration risk. Our results indicate that digital transformation significantly reduces the cost of debt financing. Mechanism tests reveal that digital transformation enables companies to broaden their operational breadth and depth, which mitigates customer concentration risk, thereby reducing default risk, and ultimately lowering the cost of debt financing. Further analyses suggest that the negative effect of digital transformation on firm's cost of debt financing is more pronounced for firms with lower market power, higher payment collection risk, elevated customer switching costs, greater supplier concentration, or a higher proportion of overseas business. Additionally, the effect is also influenced by the competitive dynamics of the industry in which the company operates. Finally, our findings indicate that digital transformation enhances firms' ability to secure bank credit. These findings contribute to the growing body of research on the economic implications of digital transformation and offer practical insights for firms seeking to leverage digital technologies to strengthen supply chain resilience, mitigate operational risks, and address financing challenges. © 2025},

	abstract = {Growing global supply chain complexity has generated interest in multi-tier management, yet most research focuses on focal firm and Tier–1 ties, overlooking Tier-2 dynamics. A specific gap exists in investigating Digital Transformation Initiatives (DTI) within triadic relationships among the focal firm and its Tier-1 and Tier-2 suppliers. This study addresses this gap by utilizing a multiple-case study approach across diverse sectors, drawing on 30 interviews, to examine the diffusion of DTI across multi-tier supply chains, with particular attention to the Double Agency Role (DAR) of Tier-1 suppliers. Using social capital theory and agency theory, our findings emphasize the key role of social capital in the DAR of Tier-1 suppliers. The importance of relational and cognitive capital varies as we shift from downstream to upstream segments of the supply chain. Relational capital is crucial in the downstream segment (focal firm–Tier-1 supplier), while cognitive capital grows in significance as we move upstream (Tier-1–Tier-2 suppliers). Additionally, we create a matrix to illustrate the relationships among social capital, the DAR, and the effectiveness of DTI diffusion. This study contributes to the digital transformation literature by expanding its focus from dyadic to triadic relationships. It also offers practical implications for supply chain managers, providing actionable insights to enhance the diffusion of DTI. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of openness in specialized search and digital transformation maturity on sustainability. In this context, the moderating role of organizational identity orientation and enabling controls is explored. To collect the data used in this research, a questionnaire was administered to small and medium-sized hotels in Brazil. The data collected from 190 small hotels were analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). This research reveals that knowledge seeking from value chain partners (VCPs) affects the level of digital transformation maturity (DTM). In the analyses, we did not find the same effect when the hotel sought research-oriented knowledge from science organization (SCIs). The findings also showed that improving the level of DTM affects economic, social and environmental sustainability. The results showed that a relational organizational identity orientation (RIO) can cause losses by transforming research-oriented external knowledge into internal knowledge. At the same time, individualistic identity (IIO) and collectivistic identity (CIO) can negatively affect the relationship between the VCPs and digital transformation. The conclusions also reveal that enabling controls moderate the relationships between the levels of DTM and sustainability in terms of economic performance. This study improves our understanding of how technology can support the efforts of hotels to achieve their sustainability goals. Specifically, this study investigates how the openness in specialized search affects sustainability through the DTM. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing the effect of such external knowledge search on DTM and by investigating whether such an effect depends on organizational identity orientation (OIO). © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study investigates the adoption of digital marketing innovations by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia, focusing on the Jabodetabek area. Utilizing a qualitative case study approach, data were collected through interviews, observations, and questionnaires with SME owners and managers. Findings indicate that 80% of respondents perceive social media as a significant factor in increasing product visibility, yet many SMEs struggle to fully optimize digital marketing due to technical knowledge limitations. Questionnaire results reveal that 65% of SMEs report a positive impact of digital marketing on sales growth, while observations highlight that businesses implementing advanced strategies—such as paid advertising and influencer collaborations—experience better sales performance than those relying solely on organic reach. The study underscores key barriers to digital marketing adoption, including a lack of expertise, resource constraints, and limited strategic planning. Additionally, the research suggests that SMEs require structured training and policy support to enhance their digital marketing capabilities. By analyzing the challenges and opportunities faced by SMEs, this study provides valuable insights for practitioners and policymakers in formulating strategies to improve digital literacy, increase market competitiveness, and drive sustainable business growth. The findings highlight the urgent need for capacity-building initiatives, such as government-supported digital literacy programs and industry partnerships, to bridge the gap in SMEs’ digital marketing proficiency. Moreover, the study contributes to the broader discourse on digital transformation by demonstrating how marketing innovation can enhance business resilience in an increasingly digital economy. Future research could explore comparative analyses between regions or sectors to provide a more comprehensive understanding of SMEs’ digital marketing adoption. Overall, this research offers a critical perspective on the role of digital marketing in fostering SME competitiveness and serves as a foundation for developing more effective support mechanisms tailored to the needs of small businesses in Indonesia. © (c) 2025 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Initiated in 1971, the Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) seeks to establish a scientific basis for strengthening the relationship between humans and the environment, recognizing humanity as an integral part of nature. Its core vehicle, the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, has expanded to 785 reserves across 142 countries. Following the momentum of four world congresses held in Minsk, Seville, Madrid, and Lima, the Hangzhou Action Plan emerged. Methods & Results: This paper systematically elaborates on the evolution of the Man and the Biosphere Programme and provides an interpretation of its latest UNESCO MAB Hangzhou Strategic Action Plan. The Plan is structured around three parts: background, action targets, and monitoring and evaluation. Its main body contains 34 action targets focusing on three key areas: supporting global environmental protection and sustainable development agendas, strengthening the construction and development of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, and advancing toward a sustainable future for humanity. Action Targets 1–13 translate global commitments—including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework—into local action by safeguarding ecosystem integrity, expanding ecological restoration, and ensuring species and genetic diversity. Action Targets 14–26 reinforce the institutional, financial, and social foundations of the network through resource mobilization, inclusive governance, knowledge sharing, and international cooperation. Finally, Action Targets 27–34 focus on strengthening scientific research, adaptive governance, and global collaboration, ensuring that biosphere reserves serve as engines of innovation and education worldwide. Compared with the Madrid Action Plan and the Lima Action Plan, the Hangzhou Action Plan demonstrates stronger integration with global frameworks, places greater emphasis on equity, rights, and operational feasibility, and highlights financing and partnerships as core pillars. Despite challenges such as balancing conservation and development, addressing climate change, and coping with uneven resources, the Plan points the way toward a sustainable future of harmony between people and nature through enhanced partnerships, mainstreaming climate adaptation strategies, and promoting digital transformation. © 2025 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Industrialization remains a cornerstone of economic transformation in developing countries, yet progress is often constrained by fragmented innovation systems, resource limitations, and institutional barriers. Open innovation offers an alternative paradigm by promoting knowledge flows across organizational and sectoral boundaries. This systematic literature review critically examines how open innovation partnership models are conceptualized, implemented, and adapted to support industrialization in low-and middle-income countries. The results demonstrate a progressive shift from linear innovation approaches to more networked, ecosystem-based configurations, with inbound, outbound, and coupled innovation strategies increasingly evident. University-industry-government (UIG) partnerships, intermediary-facilitated collaborations, and digital platforms emerge as dominant mechanisms. SMEs are pivotal actors but encounter persistent capability and resource constraints. Key enablers include institutional trust, leadership commitment, absorptive capacity, and digital in-frastructure. Conversely, barriers such as weak policy coher-ence, infrastructural deficits, and fragmented coordination inhibit innovation outcomes. The analysis also identifies emerging trajectories, notably the integration of AI and digital technologies in innovation ecosystems and the evolving role of intermediaries. This review highlights critical research gaps, particularly the need for empirically validated frameworks and SME-centric strategies and offers insights to inform policy design and the development of inclusive, adaptive innovation systems aligned with sustainable industrialization objectives. © 2025, National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE University).

	abstract = {Purpose Given the complexity and increasing interdependence of supply chain networks, a broader perspective beyond a simple binary relationship is needed to analyse the impact of supply chain networks on firms. Based on social network theory, this study aims to explore the relationship between firms’ network position in the supply chain network and digital transformation, as well as the moderating effects of structural holes and network partners’ digitalisation. Design/methodology/approach This study analyses a sample of Chinese A-share companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges for the period 2011–2020 using regression analysis to test hypothesised relationships. Findings A firm’s centrality in the supply chain network is positively related to its digital transformation, and that the firm’s structural holes and the level of network partners’ digitalisation can both strengthen the positive influence of network centrality on digital transformation. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive effect of firms’ network centrality on digital transformation is more pronounced in non-SOEs and upstream firms. Practical implications In the pursuit of digital transformation, firms should recognise the significance of their position in the supply chain network and enhance their capability for information and resource acquisition by proactively strengthening their business cooperation with other network members. Moreover, firms should emphasise the value of open networks and their partners in supply chain networks. Originality/value This study applies social network theory to investigate the role of a firm’s external supply chain network in its digital transformation, clarifying the context and boundaries in which a firm’s position in the supply chain network influences digital transformation. The results extend the research and theoretical perspective on digital transformation and the consequences of supply chain networks. © 2024 Emerald Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Purpose The increasing awareness and adoption of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), reshapes industries and daily life, fostering a proactive approach to risk management and leveraging advanced analytics, which may affect the stock price crash risk (SPCR). The main objective of the current study is to explore how AI adoption influences SPCR. Design/methodology/approach This study employs an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) fixed-effect regression model to explore the impact of AI on SPCR in Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2020. Further, number of robustness analysis (2SLS, PSM and Sys-GMM) and channel analysis are used to validate the findings. Findings The primary findings emphasize that AI adoption significantly reduces SPCR likelihood. Further, channel analysis indicates that AI adoption enhances internal control quality, contributing to a reduction in firm SPCR. Additionally, the observed relationship is notably more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) compared to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Similarly, this distinction is heightened in nonforeign enterprises (non-FEs) as opposed to foreign enterprises (FEs). The study finding also supports the notion that financial analysts enhance transparency, reducing the SPCR. Moreover, the study results consistently align across different statistical methodologies, including 2SLS, PSM and Sys-GMM, employed to effectively address endogeneity concerns. Research limitations/implications Our study stands out for its distinctive focus on the financial implications of AI adoption, particularly how it influences firm-level SPCR, an area that has been overlooked in previous research. Through the lens of information asymmetry theory, agency theory, and the economic implications of integrating AI into financial markets, our study makes a substantial contribution in mitigating SPCR. Originality/value This study underscores the pivotal role of AI adoption in influencing stock markets for enterprises in China. Embracing digital strategies, fostering transparency and prioritizing talent development are key for reaping substantial benefits. The study recommends regulatory bodies and service providers to promote AI adoption in strengthening financial supervision and ensure market stability, emphasizing the importance of investing in technologies and advancing talent development. © 2024 Emerald Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Purpose The rapid advancement of digital technologies compels companies across all industries to develop new capabilities to foster innovation and sustain competitiveness. Consequently, scholarly debates have intensified regarding how these new capabilities contribute to companies’ innovation endeavors. This study addresses this imperative by exploring two primary research questions: first, identifying the essential organizational capabilities for digital innovation; and second, examining how these capabilities facilitate innovation. The objective is to develop a comprehensive conceptual framework that classifies digital innovation capability as a higher-order organizational capacity, offering valuable insights for both academic scholarship and practical applications in digital innovation management. Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative approach, this study combines a systematic literature review with grounded theory principles to analyze 38 empirical papers from Scopus and Web of Science databases. The rigorous multi-stage coding process – open, axial and selective coding – facilitated the identification and synthesis of valuable insights for digital innovation capabilities. This approach ensures a comprehensive yet focused review, supporting the development of a robust theoretical framework. Findings Four critical capability clusters were identified to shape digital innovation capabilities: sensing, analytic-driven, digital platform and orchestration. Sensing capabilities enhance environmental awareness and enable organizations to detect market needs and opportunities, fostering customer-centric innovations. Analytic-driven capabilities leverage data for insightful decision-making and trend analysis. Digital platform capabilities highlight the strategic use of technological infrastructures to enable collaborative innovation, integrating diverse capabilities and objectives. Orchestration capabilities focus on effective coordination of resources and partnerships, ensuring sustained digital innovation by bridging capability gaps and reconfiguring resources. Collectively, these clusters offer a holistic framework for excelling in the dynamic digital innovation landscape. Originality/value While previous literature has focused on the impact of individual capabilities on digital innovation, this study offers a novel and integrative framework that categorizes digital innovation capabilities into four distinct yet interconnected clusters: sensing, analytic-driven, digital platforms and orchestration. This framework delineates the unique roles each capability plays in the digital innovation process. By synthesizing empirical studies and constructing a robust theoretical framework, this research significantly contributes to both academic scholarship and practical applications, offering essential strategies for organizations to enhance their digital innovation efforts through sustainable capability development. © 2024 Emerald Publishing Limited},

The goal is to provide a reliable and comprehensive tool for assessing the extent of DBMI in practice. Design/methodology/approach The paper follows a rigorous scale development process, which includes item generation, scale development, and purification. Validity and reliability tests were conducted using survey data from two sample sets of 485 and 459 SMEs in India. Findings The study identifies a multidimensional conceptualisation of DBMI, consisting of Value Proposition Innovation, Revenue Model Innovation, Customer Engagement Innovation, Operational Model Innovation, Ecosystem and Partnership Innovation, Organisational Innovation, and Technological Innovation. The developed scale demonstrates strong convergent and discriminant validity, confirming its usefulness as a measurement tool. Research limitations/implications This study advances the understanding of DBMI by providing a solid conceptual framework and a reliable measurement scale. However, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to establish causal relationships, suggesting the need for longitudinal studies to explore the long-term effects of DBMI. Practical implications Practitioners can use the scale to assess their organisation’s DBMI level, benchmark against industry peers, and identify areas for improvement. The scale’s multidimensional nature enables the design of targeted interventions and more efficient resource allocation for successful DBMI. Social implications A higher DBMI level can enhance organisational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and value creation, contributing to broader societal benefits such as economic growth, job creation, and innovation.

The health care sector has been lagging behind other industries in digital transformation, including investments in cybersecurity. Stakeholders’ awareness of their own responsibilities and those of others in mitigating cyber threats is often limited. Design/methodology/approach For this narrative literature review, on 30 April 2025, we searched without date, language or geographical restrictions PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore and EBM Reviews for journal articles that reported practical approaches and actionable recommendations to improve cybersecurity in health care. Our initial search returned 720 articles; following supplementary searches and screening, a total of 45 relevant documents were included. Findings Described are the expected roles of key stakeholders in mitigating cyber threats, from governments and lawmakers to health care managers, information technology experts and clinical providers. Health care organisations must step up investments in cybersecurity. Each organisation must develop and implement a strong cybersecurity strategy. State-of-the-art approaches include training to resist phishing, as well as the use of the principle of least privilege for user and administrative access, traffic monitoring tools, endpoint detection and response technologies, along with timely security patching.

In recent years, local governments like Zhejiang have faced the “impossible trinity” issue when partnering with private technology firms, due to the rising concerns about security risks. The Zhejiang government and a private tech titan found a middle ground by collaboratively forming a new state-owned special-purpose vehicle (SO-SPV) to address this issue. Although the emergence of SO-SPVs has legitimized and strengthened public-private collaboration, it may also reduce its capacity regarding ICT innovation and so bestow on technology firms greater political influence.

This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing patient satisfaction with telemedicine and provide practical guidance for improving service quality. Specifically, this study examined how service responsiveness, reliability, assurance, and empathy affect patient satisfaction while considering the role of expectation confirmation. This study employed quantitative research methods to examine telemedicine’s effect on patient satisfaction, utilizing the SERVQUAL model and expectation-confirmation theory. A structured questionnaire using a seven-point Likert scale was developed to assess the dimensions of expectancy confirmation, responsiveness, reliability, assurance, and empathy. A random sample of 333 valid questionnaires was obtained through an online platform. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the data; the findings indicated that all hypotheses were supported. Responsiveness significantly and positively influenced expectation confirmation, whereas expectation confirmation, responsiveness, reliability, assurance, and empathy significantly and positively affected patient satisfaction. The model exhibited strong explanatory power, indicating that these factors significantly influenced patient satisfaction with telemedicine. These findings provide valuable insights for healthcare providers to improve the quality of telemedicine services and patient satisfaction. These findings can guide healthcare organizations to develop more effective telemedicine platforms and training programs, contributing to the digital transformation of healthcare systems. © 2025, Mahidol University - ASEAN Institute for Health Development.

	abstract = {Recently, many companies are developing platform business models by applying IoT, big data, and AI technologies as a part of their digital transformation (DT) strategies. Using qualitative research method, the purpose of this study is to investigate how manufacturing companies use IT vendor’s capabilities to expand, integrate, and reorganize their capabilities in pursuing the new platform business model. Case studies were conducted on manufacturing companies that are pursuing big data-based platform business as their DT strategies. It was founded that the roles of IT vendors include joint development of the technology required for the platform business, formation of business ecosystem for platform services, and co-selling/co-marketing of the services to the target customers. Since the cases are limited to manufacturing companies, there may be limitations in the generalization of research results. Thus, more studies across various industries are suggested for the future study. © 2025, Korean Society of Management Information Systems. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The automotive industry is undergoing a profound transformation driven by electrification, digitalization, and evolving value chains. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the supplier sector face particular challenges in adapting their business models to these changes. This study addresses this issue by developing the PIC approach, a structured process model consisting of three phases: Preparation, Implementation, and Control. Based on a systematic literature review, the model integrates theoretical insights with practical tools tailored to SMEs. A fictitious case study demonstrates the applicability of the approach and illustrates how companies can use it to assess their current state, define a strategic direction, and manage the transformation process. Continuous improvement is supported through the integration of continuous improvement process principles. While the PIC model is conceptual in nature, it offers a promising foundation for practical application. The objective of this approach is to support successful adaptation, helping users address challenges and mitigate risks arising from ongoing changes in the automotive sector. This work is carried out within the TraFoNetz project—a regional initiative in Germany’s Northern Black Forest that supports the transformation of SMEs in the automotive supply industry. Future research will focus on validating the approach in real-world settings and refining it further. © 2025 by the author(s).},

This study analyzed 98,464 collaborative patent application records (2012–2023) from listed companies in patent-intensive sectors, sourced from the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) database. Through kernel density estimation, social network analysis, and community detection techniques, we examined the evolutionary trajectories of innovation networks and spatial patterns within these industrial clusters. Our findings indicate a notable spatial agglomeration trend in patent-intensive industries, exhibiting a prominent “core-periphery” structural feature. The core nodes of this cluster network closely align with economically developed regions, and the network structure has gradually shifted from a triangular framework supported by Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta to a diversified multilateral framework. Moreover, the community structure of the collaborative network within China’s patent-intensive industrial clusters exhibits distinct characteristics driven by technological relevance and strategic synergy, rather than strictly adhering to the principle of geographical proximity. These discoveries not only enrich the application of innovation network theory in the specific context of China, but also provide valuable guidance for cluster enterprises in selecting partners and achieving collaborative innovation. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The construction industry is now experiencing a thorough transformation through digital technologies, especially with building information modeling (BIM). Despite significant BIM advantages, most construction projects suffer from low BIM performance due to the fragmented BIM use mode. To facilitate lifecycle-integrated BIM implementation, this study demonstrates that introducing BIM lifecycle service providers (BLSPs) is feasible and offers significant improvements in terms of BIM benefits. Hence, this study proposes a customized framework to select BLSPs. Approach: This study utilized both qualitative and quantitative methods. It first adopted semi-structured interviews as part of the qualitative method to deduce the initial criteria for BLSPs’ selection. 30 interviews were conducted iteratively with managers proficient and experienced in selecting BLSPs, through which 25 initial criteria were identified. Then, as the basis of the applied quantitative method, a questionnaire survey was used to evaluate these criteria by determining the critical ones, identifying the latent factor groupings, and assigning criteria weights. Subsequently, an assessment framework was established. Finally, the study was in favor of eight construction projects, highlighting the practicality and validity of the framework. Findings: The results depicted that project BIM service capability is a primary factor for BLSPs’ selection. Within this factor, several specialized criteria need to be considered, such as “boundary spanning competence of the BIM manager” and “BIM service plans with lifecycle cognition.” Meanwhile, “past innovative BIM service practices” and “BIM research and development (R&D)” that originate in corporate innovation capacity were emphasized when selecting BLSPs. Furthermore, for holistic assessment and recognizing the peculiarities of digital BIM service, the study found that criteria like “Privacy and security” and “Backup system” are required, which demonstrate BIM service reliability. Originality/value: This study expands on the conventional partner selection frameworks in the construction sector and thus defines and validates a tailored one for BLSPs’ selection. Moreover, drawing such a reference solution from the framework, the study enables the selection of appropriate BLSPs for clients. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Health services management faces increasing complexity, particularly in developing countries such as Brazil. Digital tools play a central role in optimizing health service operations, yet synthesized evidence on manager-focused applications remains limited. This study aimed to survey digital innovations for management within the Brazilian context. Methods: We systematically reviewed the complete proceedings of the Brazilian Symposium on Computing Applied to Health (SBCAS) from 2001 to 2024, identifying 26 studies that met eligibility criteria based on managerial relevance. Results: Applications identified predominantly addressed hospital management (e.g., resource scheduling and process optimization) and public health surveillance (e.g., disease prediction and monitoring), employing technologies such as machine learning and simulation. These tools primarily leveraged structured administrative data from national health information systems, reflecting existing data infrastructure capabilities. The reported implications suggest improvements in decision-making through optimized resource allocation (e.g., ICU beds and staffing), streamlined operational processes (e.g., bottleneck identification), enhanced planning and monitoring capabilities (e.g., endemic disease control and telemonitoring programs), and more timely, targeted public health surveillance (e.g., georeferenced analysis). Conclusions: The identified research aligns with global digital health trends but is also tailored to the complex realities of the healthcare system. Despite significant technical advancements, these digital solutions predominantly remain at the prototype stage, highlighting a gap between academic innovation and real-world deployment. Realizing the benefits of these tools will require a concerted effort to move beyond technical validation, focusing on implementation science, supportive policies, and strategic partnerships to integrate these solutions into managerial practice. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Digitalization is reshaping entrepreneurship, yet the mechanisms that translate new technological possibilities into entrepreneurial intention remain poorly understood, especially for resource-constrained small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Building on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, Entrepreneurial Risk-Taking Theory and Affordance Theory, this study proposes and tests an integrated model that captures how individual cognition, digital capability and platform-related risk interact to shape digital entrepreneurial intention (DEI). Survey data from 428 Greek SME owner-managers were analyzed with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). Results show that entrepreneurial self-efficacy, financial risk tolerance, digital literacy and perceived platform affordances each exert significant positive effects on DEI, whereas perceived platform risk exerts a significant negative effect. Importantly, platform risk also dampens the positive impact of self-efficacy, revealing a boundary condition often overlooked in intention research. The findings position digital transformation as a double-edged phenomenon amplifying opportunity through affordances while simultaneously magnifying risk. The study advances theory by integrating risk perceptions and affordance recognition into a TPB framework, and it offers actionable guidance: policy makers should stabilize digital-regulatory regimes, platform providers should increase transparency and reliability, and SME support programs should blend digital-skills training with calibrated risk-management tools. Together, such measures can convert latent entrepreneurial confidence into resilient digital venture creation. This study contributes to theory by extending the Theory of Planned Behaviour with risk-sensitive boundary conditions, broadening Risk-Taking Theory to account for platform-specific uncertainties, and validating Affordance Theory in a digital SME context. Practically, it provides actionable guidance for entrepreneurs, policymakers, and platform operators on balancing digital capability development with systemic risk governance. © 2025 by the authors.},

In recent years, the scale of China’s agricultural export trade has continued to rise, fully demonstrating its potential and vitality. Based on the panel data of agricultural trade volume between China and RCEP partner countries from 2005 to 2022, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of digital trade development level on China’s agricultural exports by using stochastic frontier gravity model. The study found that RCEP partner countries’ comprehensive infrastructure construction, digital security, international competitiveness of core digital industries, and digital innovation capabilities contribute to the growth of China’s agricultural exports. The growth of GDP between China and RCEP partner countries, the signing of free trade agreements, and the improvement of trade openness can promote China’s agricultural exports to RCEP partner countries. The greater the geographical distance between China and RCEP member states, the higher tariffs imposed by RCEP member states on agricultural products will increase the cost of China’s agricultural exports, and the more unfavorable it will be to China’s agricultural exports to RCEP member states. © 2025 by the author(s).

	abstract = {The integration of digital technologies and innovative approaches into the field of social programs has become an important tool for modernizing public administration in the face of global challenges, including military crises, pandemics, and natural disasters. This topic is of particular relevance for Ukraine, which, in the context of a full-scale war, is demonstrating an unprecedented digital transformation, in particular in the field of social programs, as well as cybersecurity and defense capabilities of the state. The purpose of the article is to study digital platforms as innovative means of implementing social programs, and the object is the process of digitalization of social services in Ukraine and Estonia, and the author outlines these processes on a global scale. The main European approaches to digitalization through the prism of the Digital Decade – Policy program were also described. Special attention was paid to the digitalization of social policy in the activities of The World Bank. The experience of Estonia, as one of the world leaders in the digitalization of various spheres of life, as well as an influential partner in this area for both international organizations and individual nation states, was studied in more detail. The article traces the country’s digitalization ecology with a focus on the social component. The functional characteristics of the platforms in Ukraine “Diia” and “Kyiv Digital” were also analyzed in the context of social services provision. The key areas of digitalization, such as registration of the status of internally displaced persons, access to financial assistance, medical services, use of electronic documents, etc. were highlighted. The advantages of digital tools include mobility, accessibility, efficiency of service, reduction of administrative burden and reduction of corruption risks. At the same time, a number of problems are once again emphasized, including digital inequality, energy dependence, cyber risks, and insufficient digital competence among certain segments of the population. The practical significance of the study lies in the generalization of the Ukrainian experience of digitalization of social services. This can become the basis for developing policies in the field of social protection, digital inclusion and intercultural communication in the context of crisis transformation. © 2025, Expert Projects.

This study finds that common ownership along the supply chain significantly increases the scale of green investment, and the positive impact is stronger in regions with stronger environmental regulations, heavily polluting industries, companies with lower media attention, lower management shareholding ratios, and lower levels of digital transformation.

	abstract = {This study analyzes the factors that affect the technical efficiency (TE) of firms in the supporting industry in the context of Vietnam’s digitalized economy. Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), Fixed Effect Models, and System-GMM methods are applied to reach the findings that the quality of human resources, capital intensity, and firm size have positive effects on TE. Furthermore, exogenous environmental factors, such as the domestic demand of an industry impacting all upstream businesses, which use inputs that are products of that industry (BSpill-ratio), and the FDI backward effect (BFSpill), also exhibit positive effects. These confirm that the linkage between domestic supporting industry suppliers and FDI assembly enterprises plays an important role in improving TE. Vietnam’s digital transformation since 2020 has also created some interesting changes in the correlation coefficient. Location, sectors, competitiveness, and investment environment are also considered, and the results suggest that they are all determinants to be considered in management policies at both the firm level and the government level. Our contribution in this study is new policies aligned with many major changes in the world economic context, such as the tough tariff policy implemented by recent presidential administrations and a series of reforms of the Vietnamese Government, as well as strong digital transformation in Vietnam. The key findings of this research are important as they confirm which factors are really determinants for the Vietnamese government to implement investment policies for this industry effectively. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Transportation Management Systems (TMSs) play a pivotal role in streamlining logistics operations, yet selecting the most suitable TMS software remains a complex, multi-criteria decision-making problem. This study introduces a hybrid evaluation framework combining the Bayesian Best–Worst Method (BBWM) and TOPSIS to identify, weigh, and rank software selection criteria tailored to the logistics business. Drawing on insights from 13 logistics experts, five main criteria—technological competence, service, functionality, cost, and software developer (vendor)—and 16 detailed sub-criteria are defined to reflect business-specific needs. The core novelty of this research lies in its systematic weighting of TMS software criteria using the BBWM, offering robust and expert-driven priority insights for decision makers. Results show that functionality (26.6%), particularly load tracking (35.8%) and cost (22.7%), mainly software license cost (39.8%), are the dominant decision factors. Beyond operational optimization, this study positions TMS software selection as a strategic entry point for sustainable digital transformation in logistics. The proposed framework empowers business to align digital infrastructure choices with sustainability goals such as emissions reduction, energy efficiency, and intelligent resource planning. Applying TOPSIS to a real-world case in Türkiye, this study ranks software alternatives, with “ABC” emerging as the most favorable solution (57.2%). This paper contributes a replicable and adaptable model for TMS software evaluation, grounded in business practice and advanced decision science. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Data literacy is becoming increasingly important for healthcare professionals in both outpatient care and research. Since healthcare data and the possibilities for its use and misuse are increasing in these areas, healthcare professionals need diverse knowledge regarding the collection, use and evaluation of data. A core component of this is an understanding of the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of working with health data. (2) Methods: Within the DIM.RUHR project (Data Competence Center for Interprofessional use of Health Data in the Ruhr Metropolis), the challenge of training in data literacy for different healthcare professionals is addressed. Based on a learning objectives matrix for interprofessional data literacy education, an ELSI concept was developed through collaboration with interprofessional project partners. The study was conducted between December 2024 and April 2025. (3) Results: The foundational structure of the ELSI concept was based on the learning objectives matrix and an unstructured literacy search for ELSI concepts in similar contexts. Using an iterative design-based research approach, a group of experts from different fields (didactics, applied ethics, health sciences, law, sociology, informatics, and psychology) developed an ELSI concept for healthcare professionals. The following categories were identified as crucial: 1. philosophy of science: a basic understanding of science and the hurdles and opportunities; 2. ethics: an overview of the biomedical principles and a technological assessment; 3. law: an overview of the reservation of permission and self-determination; 4. social aspects: an overview of health inequalities and different forms of power relations and imbalances. (4) Conclusions: The ELSI concept can be used in the orientation of healthcare professionals in outpatient care and research—regardless of their profession—to develop data competencies, with the aim of providing a holistic view of the challenges and potential in the collection, use, and evaluation of healthcare data. The DIM.RUHR project’s approach is to develop open educational resources that build on the ELSI concept to teach specific skills at different competence levels. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Remote services (in which the patient and staff member are not physically colocated) and digital services (in which a patient encounter is digitally mediated in some way) were introduced extensively when the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. We undertook a longitudinal qualitative study of the introduction, embedding, evolution and abandonment of remote and digital innovations in United Kingdom general practice. This synoptic paper summarises study design, methods, key findings, outputs and impacts to date. Overview of the study and key findings: From September 2021 to December 2023, we collected > 500 hours of ethnographic observation from a diverse sample of 12 general practices. Other data sources included over 200 interviews (with practice staff, patients and wider stakeholders), 4 multi-stakeholder workshops (184 participants), grey literature (e.g. Care Quality Commission reports) and safety incident reports. Patient involvement included digitally excluded individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. homeless, complex needs). Data were de-identified, uploaded to NVivo (QSR International, Warrington, UK), coded thematically and analysed using various theoretical lenses. Despite an adverse context for general practice including austerity, workforce shortages, rising demand, rising workload and procurement challenges, all 12 participating practices adjusted to some extent to a 'new normal' of hybrid (combined traditional and remote/digital) provision following the external shock of the pandemic. By late 2023, practices showed wide variation in digital maturity from a 'trailblazer' practice which used digital technologies extensively and creatively to 'strategically traditional' practices offering mainly in-person services to deprived and vulnerable populations. We explained practices' varied fortunes using diffusion of innovations theory, highlighting the extensive work needed to embed and routinise technologies and processes. Digitally enabled patients often, but not always, found remote and digital services convenient and navigable, but vulnerable groups experienced exclusion. We explored these inequities through the lenses of digital candidacy, fractured reflexivity and intersectionality. For staff, remote and digital tasks and processes were often complex, labour-intensive, stressful and dependent on positive interpersonal relations - findings that resonated with theories of technostress, suffering and relational co-ordination. Our initial plan for workshop-based co-design of access pathways with patients was unsuccessful due to dynamic complexities; shifting to a more bespoke and agile design process generated helpful resources for patients and staff. Discussion: This study has confirmed previous findings from sociotechnical research showing that new technologies are never 'plug and play' and that appropriate solutions vary with context. Much variation in digital provision in United Kingdom general practice reflects different practice priorities and population needs. However, some practices' low digital maturity may indicate a need for additional resources, organisational support and strengthening of absorptive capacity. Negative impacts of digitalisation are common but not always inevitable; an 'inefficient' digital pathway may become more efficient over time as people adapt; and digitalisation does not affect all work processes equally (back-office tasks may be easier to routinise than clinical judgements). We have developed novel ways of involving patients from vulnerable and excluded groups, and have extended the evidence base on codesign for the busy and dynamic setting of general practice. Findings are being taken forward by national, locality-based and practice-level decision-makers; national regulators (e.g. in relation to safety); and educational providers for undergraduate, postgraduate and support staff (via a new set of competencies). Future work: Ongoing and planned work to maximise impact from this study includes using our competency framework to inform training standards, pursuing our insights on quality and safety with policy-makers, a cross-country publication for policy-makers with examples from colleagues in other countries, resources to convey key messages to different audiences, and continuing speaking engagements for academic, policy and lay audiences. Limitations: The sampling of practices was limited to Great Britain. Patient interviews were relatively sparse. While the study generated rich qualitative data which was useful in its own right, a larger sample of practices with a quantitative component could support formal hypothesis-testing, and a health economics component could allow firmer statements about efficiency. Funding: This synopsis presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health and Social Care Delivery Research programme as award number NIHR132807.; Before 2020, most general practice appointments were in-person. In March 2020, for infection control reasons, people had to phone or go online to seek appointments, and most consultations became remote (phone, video or electronic message). We studied how British general practices took these ‘disruptive innovations’ forward (or not). We used ethnography, where a researcher spends time in a practice observing and interviewing staff and patients. From mid-2021 to end 2023, we followed 12 practices (from small to large, basic to advanced technologically, and in affluent to deprived localities). We collected additional data from workshops, publicly available reports and wider interviews. We found that patients with digital devices and skills often found remote services convenient and easily navigable. But vulnerable groups – including poor, elderly, limited English speakers, refugees, and those with learning difficulties or complex health/social care needs – often struggled to access digital services (e.g. using websites or apps). By 2023, the 12 practices ranged from ‘strategically traditional’ (typically, serving populations with complex needs, for whom in-person services were often more appropriate) to a ‘digital trailblazer' (making extensive use of digital tools and delivering > 50% of consultations remotely). Digitalisation increased complexity of care. Staff reported stress (‘it feels like a call centre’), low confidence and unmet training needs. Almost all digital innovations required an extensive period of adjusting processes and pathways to fit the technology and vice versa. Measures to reduce inequities (e.g. training patients, digital navigators, walk-in services, low-tech options such as text messaging) sometimes helped. The prevailing context of austerity, workforce shortages, rising demand and need, and high workload made routinisation of digital innovations challenging. One size does not fit all. While some practices are appropriately high-tech, there are sometimes good reasons why others are not. Support for practices should focus on resourcing and optimising work processes to accommodate digital technologies, taking steps to reduce inequities of access, and ensuring staff competence and well-being.},

	abstract = {Public document legalization services in Indonesia are currently not carried out electronically, with the exception of electronic application registration (e-form) and electronic validation of apostille certificates (e-register). To adapt to the development and needs of a digital society or digital transformation, apostille legalization services must be carried out electronically (e-apostille). Based on legal provisions regarding the obligation of Electronic System Providers to organize electronic systems in a reliable, secure, and well-functioning manner, the electronic system created for the e-apostille service must be guaranteed to be reliable and secure in accordance with statutory regulations about the reliability and security of electronic systems in Indonesia. The research method used in this study is a quantitative and qualitative approach. This study uses a purposive sampling technique because sampling is carried out with certain considerations or criteria that must be met. The data collection method in this study was carried out by distributing questionnaires online through social media. In measuring respondents' answers, filling out the questionnaire was measured using a Likert scale. Statements are given a score of 1 for strongly disagree answers, a score of 2 for disagree answers, a score of 3 for doubtful answers, a score of 4 for agreed answers, and a score of 5 for strongly agreed answers. The data collection technique in this study uses a questionnaire by providing several written statements addressed to respondents, which will then be answered. Structural equation modelling is often called Partial Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS version 3.0. Using the normative juridical method, the results of this study emphasize the legal basis for the implementation of e-apostille legalization services. In addition, it also regulates the application of the obligation to use electronic system security reliability certificates through an information security management system by legal theories, the principle of legal certainty and the principle of benefit, as well as the aim of providing a sense of security in the use of information technology. This research concludes that developing regulations governing reliable and secure electronic apostille is necessary for certainty and convenience in Indonesia. Electronic apostille regulation has a positive and significant relationship with Electronic System Security, Digital signatures have a positive and significant relationship with Electronic System Security. © 2025 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

	abstract = {This study examines the intersection of intimate partner violence (IPV) and digital inequalities, focusing on the perspectives of IPV service practitioners in Norway. Through qualitative interviews with sixteen practitioners, using reflexive thematic analysis and a feminist interpretive approach, this study identifies three key findings. First, practitioners face significant challenges in incorporating digital tools into service provision due to a lack of standardized training, privacy concerns, and ever-evolving digital threats. Second, in the context of IPV, digital inequalities are observed as a major barrier preventing victim-survivors from accessing and utilizing online resources and services. Third, practitioners perceive digital technologies as both a means of enhancing survivors’ safety and autonomy and a tool for continued coercion and control by perpetrators. These findings indicate a cyclical dynamic in which IPV exacerbates digital inequalities and vice versa, constraining practitioners’ ability to offer support and restricting survivors’ capacity to navigate digital spaces safely. Moreover, the study reveals critical gaps in the recognition of technology-facilitated violence within public services and digital governance frameworks. As Norway undergoes a rapid digital transformation, the findings underscore the urgent need for policies that strengthen digital safety training for IPV service providers, enhance survivor-centered protection, and address technology-facilitated violence. By addressing these gaps, policymakers and service providers can foster safer and more inclusive digital participation for both practitioners and survivors. © © 2025 Author(s).},

This study examines the digital maturity of supplier firms within Chile’s Antofagasta mining cluster, a region that plays a central role in national productivity. A structured survey was conducted with 83 companies, using a ten-dimensional model to assess key areas such as data management, processes, personnel, and technology use. Results show that the average maturity level is 2.5 on a five-point scale, placing most firms at an early stage of digital transformation. While data-related capabilities scored relatively high, critical gaps persist in automation, robotics, and cybersecurity. Company size was moderately correlated with digital maturity, but no consistent relationship was observed with revenue growth. Although most firms acknowledge the relevance of digital technologies, few have formal plans or strategies in place. These findings reveal a structural lag that limits the potential of SMEs to engage fully with Industry 4.0, underscoring the need for tailored support policies and collaborative development initiatives in the mining sector. © 2025 by the authors.},

The first phase named “digital transformation” focuses on digitizing all operations. As such, accounting information systems (AISs)—which collect, organize, and report financial data—must evolve in alignment with this vision. This study explores how professionals in the UAE’s government-owned aviation industry view AIS adaptation to meet national digital transformation goals. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with 17 AIS experts, each with at least two years of experience in both AIS and digital transitions. The responses were then open-coded into themes centered around the objectives, benefits, challenges, and organizational impacts of AIS transformation. The findings reveal that a variety of new technologies are being used. For example, blockchain is being applied to supply chains to enhance partner traceability. AI is being used to analyze large data sets, automate repetitive tasks, and integrate non-financial data, such as for fair value assessments, to support IFRS compliance. AI is also helping to improve GDPR compliance by identifying data vulnerabilities and triggering automated safeguards. Cloud computing is also being adopted to reduce idle capacity and offer scalable flexibility. Nevertheless, some challenges were noted, such as limited employee competence and resistance to adopting new systems. © 2025 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation (DT) is imperative to improve co-ordination, collaboration, efficiency, and visibility of organizations in today's complex global supply chains. Such transformations should be driven by the internal requirements of the organization and the expectations of external stakeholders. DT attempts may fail if not aligned with people, information, processes, and existing capabilities within the organization. Even though organizations intend to start their digitalization journey by transforming the procurement process, as it directly connects to cost, productivity, quality, and compliance goals of organizations, procurement digitalization readiness is an underexplored area compared to holistic supply chain maturity, indicating a gap in both research and practice. The main objective of this research is to spotlight the complexities related to procurement digitalization and develop a novel maturity model that combines the strengths of fuzzy logic with a comprehensive and generic maturity framework tailored for the systematic assessment of procurement function. A six-phase structured approach encompassing literature review, criteria validation, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) integration, survey execution, fuzzy model application and validation is used to develop a generic mathematical algorithm to assess DT readiness. Case studies across various sectors such as energy, banking, defense, manufacturing, healthcare, education, and construction demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed model in addressing vagueness in maturity investigations. Manufacturing industry demonstrates the highest readiness, in terms of adopting strategic approaches towards digitization and market innovation. Most sectors require significant improvement in supplier relationships, especially to utilize vast available information and manage risks proactively with advanced digital tools. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The financial services system shows a significant part in offering sustainable financial services (SFSs) to prod sustainability perspectives under different enterprises and firms worldwide. Though, impacts for digital transformations on financial service suppliers are dawdling, and little study has been recognized in this sector. Until now, very few decision-making frameworks have been piloted in this sector as well. Thus, this paper first commences a systematic review of existing sustainable financial service (SFS) systems to begin a trend of existing SFS actions to improve future research prospects. Owing to association of various sustainability facets, the assessment of the digital transformation challenges in SFS systems can be treated as a multi-criteria group decision-making (MCDM) problem. The objective of paper is to develop hybrid interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF)-based decision-making model for assessing digital transformation challenges in SFS systems and choosing a suitable sustainability-related SFS system under uncertainty setting. In the following, an integrated weight determining method is developed using the proposed IVPF-entropy and rank sum method. Further, the multi-attribute multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis is developed for ranking and selecting sustainability-related SFS systems. A case study to evaluate the digital transformation challenges of SFS systems in banking sector is discussed. Comparison and sensitivity discussions are given to show the advantages of the proposed approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.},

	abstract = {The wave of digitization is sweeping across the world, boosting the transformation of various industries and bringing unprecedented new opportunities for firms. This paper examines the impact of digital transformation of customer firms on the financing constraints of suppliers. We find a significant spillover effect in the supply chain that the digital transformation degree of customer firms is negatively correlated with the financing constraints of suppliers when the comprehensive performance of customers is better. Furthermore, this effect is more evident for suppliers that are smaller, with shorter years of listing, and located in regions with fewer banks and greater distances from their customers. Additionally, the impact is more pronounced for customers that are state-owned and belong to high-tech industries. The mechanism test shows that the digital transformation of customers mainly alleviates the financing constraints of suppliers by reducing the information asymmetry of customer firms, increasing the credit availability and lowering the private equity placements discounts of suppliers. Additionally, the digital transformation of customers significantly reduces the cost of debt financing for suppliers. These findings enrich research on financing constraints and digital transformation, as well as provide important implications for companies within the supply chain on how to mitigate financing constraints through digital transformation. © 2025},

Based on resource orchestration theory (ROT), this study uses data from Chinese A-share listed firms and their supply chain partners spanning 2011–2022 as a sample to explore the mechanisms by which the dominant position of chain leaders suppresses greenwashing within supply chains. It also examines the contextual effects of digital transformation and government supervision. The findings reveal that: (1) chain leaders utilize dual pathways, namely, coordination (reducing supply–demand coordination costs and reconstructing business credit networks) and guidance (cultivating green cognition and facilitating green technological spillovers) to suppress greenwashing; (2) digital transformation unexpectedly exacerbates greenwashing, whereas government supervision strengthens governance efficacy; (3) greenwashing among geographically proximate partners and customer partners is more significantly influenced by chain leaders' governance. This study challenges the traditional supply chain efficiency paradigm by introducing a network-embedded explanation for greenwashing behavior. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This paper reviews the literature to analyse the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in collaborative processes among supply chain (SC) partners, thereby forming a collaborative network (CN). Given the growth of AI and its limited exploration in many business strategies, especially when collaboration among SC partners’ is established, this paper focuses on defining the lines of research and application of AI in CN processes, by presenting insights into how AI can improve the resilience and the antifragility. It examines the integration of AI in CN processes from the following perspectives: (i) the collaborative processes addressed among the CN partners, (ii) the decision-making level of the collaborative processes performed, (iii) the SC partners involved in the collaboration; (iv) the technologies combined with AI to support CN processes; (v) the programming languages implemented to develop AI algorithms; (vi) the SC sectors in which AI is mainly implemented to perform collaborative processes; and (vii) the potential of implementing AI in CN processes, in an increasingly turbulent and disruptive business world. The study focuses on SC in various sectors, including food, transport, logistics, manufacturing, healthcare or electronics, among others. In addition, the review provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between collaborative processes and AI-driven advances, identifying the technologies that can merge with AI to support CN processes. The results have enabled the development of a conceptual framework for AI use collaborative processes and outline the benefits, risks and challenges associated with the use of AI in CN, while proposing future research directions in this area. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Social entrepreneurship (SE) is emerging as a transformative force for sustainable development, particularly in contexts marked by inequality, informality, and institutional gaps. This study adopts an integrative and critical approach to examine how SE aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and contributes to inclusive, resilient, and innovation-driven change. It addresses key research gaps—fragmented theoretical applications, limited sectoral analysis, and weak methodological generalizability—by synthesizing six foundational theories: behavioral decision theory, theory of planned behavior, social cognitive theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, and grounded theory. A systematic literature review was conducted using the PRISMA protocol to ensure rigor and transparency in selecting studies from 2015 to 2024. The review identifies thematic gaps in existing literature, including underexplored areas such as sector-specific financing, digital innovation, entrepreneurship in emerging sectors, sustainable technology adoption, and the contextual embedding of SE within SDG-linked outcomes. Using the theory-context-characteristics-methods (TCCM) framework and machine learning-based BERTopic modeling, this study analyzes SE research to offer both conceptual depth and empirical mapping. Its originality lies in the interdisciplinary integration of theory with advanced text analytics to uncover actionable, theory-driven insights into SE–SDG alignment. Findings reveal SEs’ contributions to SDGs 4, 8, and 9 through inclusive models and digital tools such as AI and blockchain. SE also advances SDGs 10, 11, and 12 while being enabled by institutions (SDG 16) and partnerships (SDG 17). The study calls for multilevel theoretical integration across cognitive, relational, and institutional domains, with managerial implications for hybrid model design, stakeholder collaboration, and digital capability building. © 2025 The Author(s)},

Moreover, the mitigating effect of digital innovation is particularly pronounced in firms with greater geographical supply chain distances, higher operational complexity, extensive overseas operations, short-term relationships with partners, and those in the manufacturing sector. We further demonstrate that digital innovation enhances information sharing and improves operational efficiency, serving as potential mechanisms for supply chain risk reduction.

	abstract = {The concept of “chained vulnerability” addresses the cyberattack risks for organizations through interconnected internal and external actors (e.g., employees and suppliers). As organizational defenses and tactics of antagonistic actors (e.g., hackers) adapt to emerging conditions, certain actors of organizations become compromised as entry points into the targeted organizations. A disruption (i.e., COVID-19) induces operational changes (i.e., digital transformation), and we study the co-evolution of attacks and defenses as if the antagonistic actors, organizations, and their internal and external actors are engaged in a dance together. Building on routine activity theory, our study theorizes the adaptive target suitability where the properties of actors, the types of actors involved, and the consequential phases co-evolve following the disruption. We leverage the COVID-19 pandemic as the empirical context and use a novel dataset of 3497 publicly reported cyber breaches. Analyses reveal that cyberattacks initially focused on internal actors (i.e., deception-based attacks on employees) and then shifted to external actors (i.e., system vulnerability-based attacks on digital infrastructure providers and product suppliers). Semi-structured interviews with experts (e.g., hackers and cybersecurity managers) and subsequent econometric analyses elucidate how strategic interactions between dance partners lead to disruptions that dynamically reshape the landscape of chained vulnerability. © 2025 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Digital health innovations are increasingly being designed to support chronic disease management. Digital health innovations may be particularly valuable for supporting health coaching interventions for type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission. To design more effective digitally enabled health coaching for T2D remission, design methods that utilize co-design, design thinking, and service blueprinting may be advantageous. Methods: A one-day collaborative design thinking workshop in Toronto, Canada involved health coaches from pan-Canadian T2D remission research sites. Health coaches reflected on their experiences and identified digital innovation opportunities. Workshop activities included empathizing with each other, defining clear opportunities, and ideating solutions. Data were collected through audio recordings, field notes, and activity outputs, and then analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Researchers synthesized the data into a service blueprint, which outlined specific needs for delivering future digitally enabled T2D remission programming. Results: Health coaches emphasized the importance of personalized goal setting, deep relationship building, and responsive behavioral recommendations in effective T2D remission coaching. Coaches envisioned digital tools as fundamental for improving information accessibility, streamlining workflows, and delivering tailored support throughout the T2D remission journey. The developed service blueprint pinpointed key opportunities where digital technology could enhance the coaching process over time, offering actionable solutions to address patient, coach, provider, and system needs. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the transformative potential of using co-design, design thinking, and service blueprinting to create more meaningful digital health self-management interventions. Future research should validate the developed service blueprint in real-world settings and explore the impact of digitally enabled health coaching on long-term T2D remission outcomes. © 2025 Diabetes Technology Society},

This paper is the first of its kind to analyse how digital technologies hinder the efficacy of sanctuary policies, potentially rendering them obsolete. Drawing on comparative evidence from the UK and Canada, it explores how digitally-driven responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by different government levels (local, regional, national) have impacted migrants’ rights. Findings reveal that increasing interoperability among population databases has crucially enhanced immigration authorities’ capacity to access sensitive data collected by local service providers, facilitating the detection, detention, and deportation of precaritised migrants. These practices of hostile data-sharing weaken pre-existing sanctuary protections that rely on limited cooperation between local and national officials. However, some local actors have deployed fresh counter-strategies, notably building non-interoperable data management infrastructures to ensure safer access to basic healthcare services. While prior research has examined digital transformations in immigration enforcement and welfare systems separately, this paper bridges these debates to reveal how digitisation tightens border controls within everyday urban life and what avenues of resistance remain available to migrant rights advocates. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Under the dual challenges of intelligent transformation and insufficient profitability of automobile manufacturing industry, the traditional financial control model is difficult to adapt to the dynamic market environment due to the problems of data silo and decision-making lag. Based on the framework of dynamic capability theory and the exploratory case of XX Automobile, this study adopts big data technology, machine learning algorithms, and combines blockchain, Internet of Things, database and other information technologies to systematically reveal the intrinsic mechanism of financial control innovation driven by the integration of industry finance and tax. The study found that: (1) Dynamic capabilities empower financial control innovation through the three phases of "sensing-capturing-reconstructing": Relying on big data technology to accurately identify the core drivers of ROE downturn, using machine learning models (decision tree, K-means clustering) to optimize the forecast of capital demand and supplier screening, and reorganizing the financial control innovation with the help of blockchain and distributed database (MongoDB), the study found that: (2) The dynamic ability of the financial management system is a key factor in financial management innovation. With the help of blockchain and distributed database (MongoDB), the company reconstructs the whole value chain process of procurement, cost and sales, and realizes the in-depth synergy of industry finance and tax data. (2) At the practical level, green bond financing reduces capital costs by 30%, intelligent production line siting model significantly improves work efficiency and reduces carbon emissions by 117,300 tons, and RFM analysis and regression analysis accurately locate high-value customers and Belt and Road potential markets to promote export revenue growth. The conclusion of the study shows that dynamic capability theory provides an innovative path of "technology empowerment-decision optimization-strategic leap"for the integration of industry finance and tax, which not only verifies its theoretical applicability in the field of finance, but also provides a replicable practical paradigm for digital transformation of the automobile manufacturing industry, and at the same time contributes to the strategic insights of green finance and ESG governance. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {In the era of Industry 4.0, digital transformation has become a key driver of corporate development. Despite its profound significance, there is a dearth of research examining its underlying influencing mechanisms. To fill this gap, this study investigates the impact of firms’ digital transformation on firm performance and explores the moderating role of supply chain concentration using a sample of Chinese listed firms from 2011 to 2021. Drawing on transaction cost and knowledge-based theories, digital technologies boost efficiency and flexibility, reduce transaction costs, and enable the leveraging of a diverse resource pool, which ultimately leads to improved performance among supply chain participants. The results indicate a positive contribution of digital transformation to firm performance in China. Notably, the relationship is moderated by supply chain concentration, with digital transformation exerting a more significant effect on firm performance in companies with low customer concentration and high supplier concentration. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This evolution is particularly crucial in the human rights sector where focus has shifted from the establishment of human rights frameworks to demands for actions beyond pronouncements. A critical challenge lies in ensuring the implementation of human rights court decisions, a major issue confronting the African human rights system. The African human rights system, notably the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, faces persistent challenges in implementing its judgments largely due to the absence of a comprehensive monitoring system. This paper suggests that the African Court, through collaborative partnerships, could strategically utilise technology in its monitoring system to address implementation challenges, thereby ensuring tangible improvements in human rights protection. © Edinburgh University Press.},

	abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education offers novel opportunities to enhance critical thinking while also posing challenges to independent cognitive development. In particular, Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) in education aims to enhance human experience by providing a supportive and collaborative learning environment. Rather than replacing the educator, HCAI serves as a tool that empowers both students and teachers, fostering critical thinking and autonomy in learning. This study investigates the potential for AI to become a collaborative partner that assists learning and enriches academic engagement. The research was conducted during the 2024–2025 winter semester within the Pedagogical and Teaching Sufficiency Program offered by the Audio and Visual Arts Department, Ionian University, Corfu, Greece. The research employs a hybrid ethnographic methodology that blends digital interactions—where students use AI tools to create artistic representations—with physical classroom engagement. Data was collected through student projects, reflective journals, and questionnaires, revealing that structured dialog with AI not only facilitates deeper critical inquiry and analytical reasoning but also induces a state of flow, characterized by intense focus and heightened creativity. The findings highlight a dialectic between individual agency and collaborative co-agency, demonstrating that while automated AI responses may diminish active cognitive engagement, meaningful interactions can transform AI into an intellectual partner that enriches the learning experience. These insights suggest promising directions for future pedagogical strategies that balance digital innovation with traditional teaching methods, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of education. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of integrating reflective practices and adaptive frameworks to support evolving student needs, ensuring a sustainable model. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Advanced technologies, such as robotic process automation, blockchain, and machine learning, increase audit efficiency. Nonetheless, some Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) have not undergone digital transformation. This research aimed to develop a comprehensive framework for supreme audit institutions to adopt and integrate emerging technologies into their auditing processes using a hybrid theoretical approach based on the TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) and TOE (Technology–Organisation–Environment) models. The framework was informed by insights from nineteen highly experienced experts in the field from eight countries. Through a two-round Delphi questionnaire, the experts provided valuable input on the key factors, challenges, and strategies for successful technology adoption by public sector audit organisations. The findings of this research reveal that technology adoption in SAIs starts with solid management support led by the chief technology officer. They must evaluate the IT infrastructure and readiness for advanced technologies, considering the budget and funding. Integrating solutions like the SAI of Ghana’s Audit Management Information System can significantly enhance audit efficiency. Continuous staff training is essential to build a positive attitude toward new technologies, covering areas like data algorithm auditing and big data analysis. Assessing the complexity and compatibility of new technologies ensures ease of use and cost-effectiveness. Continuous support from technology providers and monitoring advancements will keep SAIs aligned with technological developments, enhancing their auditing capabilities. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As organizations continue to embrace digital transformation, the need for robust cybersecurity strategies has never been more critical. This paper explores the Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as a contemporary cybersecurity framework that addresses the challenges posed by increasingly interconnected systems. Zero Trust (ZT) operates under the principle of “never trust, always verify,” ensuring that every access request is thoroughly authenticated, regardless of the requester’s location within or outside the network. However, implementing ZT is a challenging task, requiring an adequate roadmap to prioritize the different initiatives in agreement with company culture, exposure and cyber posture. We apply multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate the relative importance of various components within a ZT framework, using the Incomplete Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP). Expert opinions from professionals in cybersecurity and IT governance were gathered through structured questionnaires, leading to a prioritized ranking of the eight key ZT pillars, as defined by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Washington, DC, USA, along with a prioritization of the sub-elements within each pillar. The study provides actionable insights into the implementation of ZTA, helping organizations prioritize security efforts to mitigate risks effectively and build a resilient digital infrastructure. The evaluation results were used to create a prioritized framework, integrated into the ZEUS platform, developed with Teleconsys S.p.A., to enable detailed assessments of a firm’s cyber partner regarding ZT and identify improvement areas. The paper concludes by offering recommendations for future research and practical guidance for organizations transitioning to a ZT model. © 2025 by the authors.},

It argues that, unlike Cold War technological rivalries driven by centralized, state-led control, today’s digital competition depends on states’ capacity to orchestrate scalable, multistakeholder ecosystems. Using a cultural–institutional framework, we explain how differences in strategic culture and institutional governance impact the ecosystem’s vitality and performance. A qualitative comparative analysis of the United States, China, and Russia reveals that constructive orchestration, aligning state institutions with generative, commercial-to-national innovation flows, enhances digital leadership, whereas rigid, obstructive governance limits it. This highlights ecosystem governance as a critical dimension of statecraft in the digital age. The findings underscore that the positions of great powers in the global technological hierarchy depend not only on resources or capabilities but also on the effectiveness of ecosystem governance as an evolving instrument of geopolitical power. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The 2024 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) Summit in Warsaw focused on the digital transformation of arrhythmia management, convening over 130 stakeholders from academia, industry, and policy. This review summarises the current state (in 2025) and future directions of digital health in arrhythmia care, including remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), mobile health (mHealth), artificial intelligence (AI), and integration into the European Health Data Space (EHDS). RM has become central to CIED follow-up, improving outcomes and reducing healthcare use. However, challenges in reimbursement, workforce adaptation, and data interoperability persist. The absence of standardised data exchange between device vendors and healthcare systems has led to initiatives like the World Forum on CIED follow-up to develop interoperability standards. mHealth tools, including apps and wearable devices, offer accurate arrhythmia detection but face regulatory, digital literacy, and privacy barriers. The EHDS aims to enable cross-border data sharing for personalised care and real-world research, though implementation must address ethical, legal, and infrastructural issues. AI shows promise in prediction, monitoring, and data integration, but lacks standardised, transparent validation. The ESC-EHRA Atlas in Heart Rhythm Disorders supports structured data collection to harmonize and benchmark care across Europe. Overall, digital innovations, if coupled with regulatory alignment, interoperability standards, and equitable access, have the potential to shift arrhythmia management toward a more predictive, personalized, and efficient model of care. © 2025 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study investigates the role of digital marketing strategies in improving market access and consumer awareness among producers in Egypt’s black honey (molasses honey) sector. With market dynamics and consumer behavior increasingly shaped by digital transformation, understanding these relationships is critical for the agricultural industry. Data were collected through surveys of 50 stakeholders from 13 molasses honey companies using purposive sampling to include marketing managers, production supervisors, and quality assurance officers. Multiple regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between digital marketing strategies, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder collaboration (independent variables) and market access (dependent variable). The results showed that digital marketing strategies significantly enhanced market access (coefficient = 0.35, 99% confidence level) and that consumer awareness was a strong predictor (coefficient = 0.28, 95% confidence level). Regulatory compliance and stakeholder collaboration also had positive effects, with regulatory compliance approaching significance (p = 0.080). Mediation analysis confirmed that both regulatory compliance and collaboration mediated the relationship between digital marketing and market access. As one of the first studies in Egypt to explore these links in the agricultural sector, this research provides new insights into how producers can improve visibility and accessibility in competitive markets. The findings highlight the importance of investing in digital marketing initiatives and fostering collaboration to strengthen market performance. Policymakers are encouraged to support producers in building digital capabilities and promoting partnerships to enhance competitiveness and adaptability in a rapidly changing environment. © 2025 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Fraudulent healthcare insurance claims cause an ongoing critical problem that affects the growth rate of healthcare services in many countries because of increased medical costs since companies usually pay the claims amount when they should not have to. Based on Health Insurance’s medical claims submission data from 2019 to 2021, fraudulent claims have significantly increased over time. Moreover, the large volume of claims submissions on a daily basis (approximately 2.5 million per day) makes human reviews difficult. Currently, healthcare organizations have traditionally depended on manual review processes by claims assessors. However, these processes are time-consuming and often do not identify fraudulent activity due to the high volume of claims submissions each day and the service level agreement target. Thus, an automated claims assessment system to reduce the inefficient review process by humans is essential. Herein, we present an automated fraudulent claims detection model based on machine learning. This has a large impact on the claims assessment process by successfully integrating digital transformation to reduce costs, improve accuracy, and be less laborious. Our model based on supervised machine learning was implemented and evaluated for a health insurance service provider on approximately 800,000 insurance claims records from hospitals within the past three years. In the preprocessing step, we manage multiple tasks such as discretization to classify the data into discrete values and applying the Min-Max scalar for feature scaling and balancing. For the classifier model, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and XGBoost are used to evaluate the performance of model Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We compared the model performance with and without preprocessed data to prove that the selected preprocessing methods could significantly improve the model performance.

	abstract = {The mining industry (MI) underpins global economic and technological progress by supplying essential raw materials for energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure. Yet, its digital transformation, vital for enhancing sustainability and efficiency, is hindered by complex, interconnected challenges. Prior research often examines these challenges in isolation, lacking quantitative causal modeling. This study proposes the Rough Interval-Valued Neutrosophic Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (RIVN-DEMATEL) method to analyze interdependencies among challenges to digital technology adoption in the MI. Integrating rough set theory and neutrosophic logic, RIVN-DEMATEL robustly manages uncertainty in expert judgments, validated via Spearman and Pearson correlation analyses. Key findings identify scalability challenges, cultural inertia, and dynamic operational conditions as dominant causal drivers, which exacerbate effect factors such as resistance to change, cybersecurity risks, and ROI uncertainty. Scalability constraints, for instance, amplify integration issues and data complexity, while cultural barriers fuel workforce resistance. These results underscore the need to address root causes to mitigate downstream impacts. Practical implications include launching modular pilot projects to demonstrate scalability, fostering cultural change through transformational leadership, and implementing reskilling programs to build digital literacy. Moreover, policymakers should establish adaptive regulatory frameworks and offer financial incentives, such as grants for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to reduce adoption challenges. By synthesizing fragmented insights into a structured decision-support model, this study fills critical literature gaps, providing mining companies, policymakers, and technology providers a roadmap to advance operational efficiency, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility through digital innovation. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

By integrating evolutionary game theory with system dynamics, this study constructs a four-party evolutionary game model for regulatory agencies, enterprises, data suppliers and trading platforms, and a simulation analysis was performed on the evolution path of the market equilibrium state caused by changes in key factors. The results indicate that: (1) a significant positive feedback mechanism exists between stringent regulation and active compliance by data suppliers, effectively alleviating compliance inadequacies; likewise, enterprise digital transformation and platform intelligent services also demonstrate significant positive feedback, contributing to resolving supply-demand mismatches. (2) Measures including enhanced regulatory benefits, reduced regulatory costs, increased benefits and reduced costs of enterprise digital transformation, and lowered platform intelligent upgrading costs collectively drive the market toward an ideal equilibrium (characterized by stringent regulation, active compliance, digital transformation, and intelligent services). Conversely, unfavorable conditions lead to a non-ideal equilibrium state, characterized by decreased compliance, reduced market participation, and lower efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The desertification of bank branches, driven by digital transformation, has exacerbated financial exclusion among individuals less keen to adopt digital channels or those living in lower-income and less densely populated regions. In this scenario, postal operators have emerged as main competitors in providing physical and face-to-face financial services in areas without a banking presence, leveraging their capillary network of post offices. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to support postal providers in decision-making concerning the network design for consulting services. The model aims to maximize the attracted demand of customers who are financially excluded due to branch closures, by identifying the best locations among post offices where to activate consulting services and planning the availability in terms of time windows. The model has been applied to the rural areas of the Campania region in southern Italy, where bank branch closures have significantly impacted customers’ access to banking services. The results demonstrate that the model can effectively support the consulting network design process, offering an effective framework for making appropriate decisions based on preferred provision policy. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The electrical energy consumption is increasing day by day to meet customer demand in new industries development, electric vehicle charging, and railways. The intermittent renewable energy resources are integrated in the power grid to meet the increasing demand and to reduce greenhouse emissions. Hence, essential strategy is to reduce the power consumption of the existing industry with the same productivity to make the plant profitable avoiding pollution and global warming. In the foundry industries, furnaces are the key equipment that consumes more power to melt the iron metal scrap to liquid metal for manufacturing castings. To make a foundry profitable, power consumption and worker’s salary are the important parameters since the cost of energy per unit, raw material, and transportation may not be controlled easily by the plant. To optimize the energy cost, each industry is purchasing a limited maximum demand (MD) power since for each allotted MD values in kVA are chargeable whether the maximum limit of the MD is consumed or not. If the allotted MD is crossed at any instant of a time over a billing cycle, there will be a huge penalty for the utilized over the limit in KVA values from the energy supplier. In conventional foundry industries, called Industry 3.0, each furnace has separate circuit breaker switches and a separate maximum demand controller where the MD is set manually based on the expertise suggestions to avoid excess MD penalty. When the MD exceeds this limit, the maximum demand controller of the respective furnace will trip the corresponding circuit breaker. Hence, the furnace that is in production cannot raise the power beyond the maximum demand control limit of that furnace though the designed capacity of the furnace is high. In the proposed system, if power is not utilized by any furnace due to any planned or unplanned stoppage or reduction of power due to operation constraints, the unutilized power is diverted to another furnace to utilize the allotted maximum demand of power in an optimum way within the limit of the allotted MD. In the proposed system, PLC and SCADA are used for digital transformation to achieve Industry 4.0 standards, collecting the actual power consumption data of each furnace and sharing the unutilized power to slave furnaces in an optimum way by using LSTM-based PID controller and adaptive fuzzy logic controller without crossing the allotted maximum demand of the plant and decreases the energy consumption per metric ton of liquid metal production by 7.6%. The conserved electrical energy increases the profit of the plant, reduces CO<inf>2</inf> emission by 557,568 MT per annum to save the world from global warming and pollution, and increases the productivity by 7.1% without affecting the quality of the product. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation has revolutionized public service delivery, yet studies on societal engagement with e-Government services in Qatar remain limited. Despite significant investments in digital governance, 70% of services continue to be accessed through traditional methods, indicating barriers to adoption. This study examines the factors influencing societal self-motivation to use e-Government platforms, with a focus on cultural and institutional challenges. This research employs a qualitative methodology, including semi-structured interviews with representatives from government agencies, NGOs, and the private sector. The study also integrates secondary data sources to provide a broader contextual analysis. Findings reveal that while Qatar has advanced digital infrastructure and governance principles emphasizing transparency and efficiency, low digital self-motivation, privacy concerns, and a preference for traditional service methods hinder e-Governance adoption. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) explain how perceived ease of use, trust, and social influence shape engagement. The study recommends targeted awareness campaigns, NGO collaboration, and digital literacy initiatives to enhance societal engagement with e-Government services. Strengthening privacy protections and promoting a digital government culture through community-based outreach can foster wider adoption. Addressing these challenges is critical for realizing the full potential of Qatar's digital transformation and ensuring inclusive, transparent governance. © 2025 The Author(s).
