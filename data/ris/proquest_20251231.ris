T1  - Modeling Competitive Strategies for Ukrainian Retailers in the Context of Sustainable Development and Digital Transformation
AN  - 3281465944
AB  - This study is aimed at modeling competitive strategies of Ukrainian retailers in the context of sustainable development and digital transformation. It emphasizes how Ukrainian retail chains, adapting to war-related challenges and digital transformation, align their strategies with the SDGs, particularly those related to economic growth, innovation, responsible consumption, climate action, and partnerships. Based on 2024 financial indicators, a dynamic model of competition between the two largest Ukrainian food retailers – ATB-Market LLC - Market LLC and Silpo-Food LLC – was developed. The model belongs to the class of asymmetric “predator–prey” systems and allows describing the interaction between dominant and dependent market participants. The analysis revealed four stationary points, two of which correspond to potential bankruptcy scenarios. The dynamics near equilibrium points are volatile, indicating the sensitivity of the retail trade system to external shocks. An analysis of the phase trajectory shows a progressive trend toward greater stability in Ukraine’s retail market, despite military turmoil. The study identifies key stages in the development of retail trade in the context of sustainable growth and digital transformation, investigates the challenges of strategic decision-making for chain retailers, and highlights the main obstacles to digital transformation that could hinder future progress. The results provide theoretical and practical insights into how Ukrainian retailers can strengthen their competitiveness, ensure sustainability, and contribute to the achievement of SDGs in times of economic uncertainty.

T1  - Promotion or hindrance? Digital transformation of the supply chain and total factor productivity of midstream enterprises
AN  - 3254281223
AB  - Digital transformation is essential for high-quality enterprise development, yet many firms face challenges due to limited resources and capabilities. This study analyzes supply chain data from A-share listed companies in China (2007–2022) using the fixed effects model, instrumental variable techniques, Heckman two-stage model, and mechanism test model to examine the spillover effects of upstream and downstream enterprises’ digital transformation on midstream enterprises’ total factor productivity and its underlying mechanisms. The results show that: (1) Digital transformation by upstream and downstream supply chain partners significantly enhances the total factor productivity of midstream enterprises—a finding that remains robust across multiple tests. (2) This effect operates through two main channels: technological progress and factor reallocation. The former is driven by enhanced digital adoption, increased research and development investment, and improved innovation quality, while the latter optimizes capital allocation and upgrades the labor structure. (3) The spillover effect is stronger when firms are geographically distant, operate in different industries, or when midstream enterprises exhibit higher supply chain dependency. This study offers theoretical insights and practical guidance for promoting high-quality development through supply chain-oriented digital transformation strategies.

T1  - Unveiling the role of stakeholder involvement for digital transformation of Indian food SMEs
AN  - 3226592612
AB  - With the advent of digitalization, the economy of the world is quickly changing itself and Indian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the front runners. This study sheds light on how digital transformation is crucial to support the growth, competitiveness, and sustainability in the present business environment, and how digital transformation is important to the SMEs in India. To encourage SMEs to take up digital technologies, the Government of India has been creating an environment that encourages such moves by launching several initiatives including Digital India, Make in India and Startup India. This paper studies the role of stakeholder involvement in digital transformation in Indian food SMEs. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used on survey responses from 103 food SMEs using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). From the findings, there is a close relationship between stakeholder involvement and technological advancement (β = 0.595, p < 0.001) and organizational and political factors (β = 0.709, p < 0.001) as viewed by leadership, which reflects multidimensional factors leading to digital adoption. However, stakeholder involvement does not have any significant effect on financial factors (β = 0.018, p = 0.87), financial constraints being a major barrier to transformation. Moreover, although technological advancement results in a positive effect towards digital transformation (β = 0.694, p < 0.001), organizational and financial challenges act as stumbling blocks altogether. In the case of managers, this study indicates proactive involvement of stakeholders, investment in employees upskilling and alignment of organizational goals with digital initiatives for the support of technology adoption. This information assists decision makers in estimating government incentives and public private partnerships to overcome financial constraints. Digital transformation for food sector SMEs depends on a coordinated support of stakeholders, policy and technological readiness as preconditions for long term competitiveness.

T1  - BARRIERS TO DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN ZIMBABWEAN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
AN  - 3244090089
AB  - This study explores the barriers to digital transformation in Zimbabwean local governments using a qualitative desktop review methodology. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the TechnologyOrganization-Environment (TOF) framework, the analysis identifies key obstacles that hinder the uptake and institutionalisation of digital governance. The study categorises these barriers into four domains: political and regulatory, technological, economic, and social-human capital. Findings reveal outdated policies, weak coordination, infrastructure deficits, limited financial resources, digital illiteracy, and resistance to change as persistent challenges. Comparative insights from Indonesia, Denmark, and South Korea demonstrate how strategic policy alignment, digital literacy programmes, and inclusive governance models can support successful digital reforms. Based on these findings, the study recommends the development of a national digital strategy for local governments, investment in critical infrastructure, enhanced ICT capacity building, inclusive governance mechanisms, and sustainable financing models. The paper concludes with a call for empirical research to assess the real-world experiences of stakeholders and track the evolution of digital governance capacity over time. These insights aim to guide policymakers, development partners, and local authorities toward a more inclusive and resilient digital future for Zimbabwean municipalities.

T1  - The effect of supplier digitalization on customer firm emissions
AN  - 3273986918
AB  - The application of digital technology is a crucial means to achieve low-carbon development goals, with supplier firms’ digital transformation driving supply chain optimization as a key pathway to this goal. This study systematically examines the forward spillover effects of supplier firms’ digital transformation. Using panel data from A-share listed companies in China over the period 2007–2022, we focus on vertical supply chain linkages. The results indicate that supplier firms’ digital transformation significantly reduces customer firms’ environmental pollution emissions, a conclusion that remains robust across various tests. Moreover, we find that this effect is asymmetric: it is significantly stronger when suppliers’ digitalization levels exceed those of their customers. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the pollution-reduction effect is stronger when customer firms are located in regions with lower resource endowments, have higher supply-chain dependence, operate in non-heavy-pollution industries, or are non-state-owned enterprises. Mechanism analysis demonstrates that supplier digitalization achieves these gains by enhancing green technological innovation and increasing external stakeholder attention. The findings provide a foundation for fully leveraging the environmental potential of digital transformation within supply chains and offer important insights into advancing supply chain modernization and promoting green, high-quality development.

T1  - Digital transformation and pathways for promoting global value position: an empirical study in Chinese manufacturing industries
AN  - 3258210301
AB  - Digital transformation offers new avenues for the photovoltaic manufacturing industry and his paper, grounded in value chain theory, collaborative management theory, and value chain cost control theory, examines digital transformation through three key dimensions: process optimization, platform ecosystem development, and data-driven strategies. The results show that digital transformation has effectively streamlined R&D, procurement, production, and sales costs. Notably, the R&D expenditure as a percentage of operating income decreased from around 4.2% to 3.1%. Furthermore, after digital transformation, significant improvements were seen in supplier delivery qualification rates, market share, and customer satisfaction.

T1  - Fostering Digital Transformation in MSMEs: The Role of Leadership, Culture, and the Mitigation of Technostress
AN  - 3249312252
AB  - A fast communication network allows MSME entrepreneurs to collaborate with suppliers and customers, access realtime data, and adapt to the ever-changing market landscape and supply chain (Kraft, Lindeque and Peter, 2022).

According to Ellyawati and Kusumatriawan (2024), compatibility is an important factor in adopting technology.

Work engagement is widely accepted as a major factor that has a strong positive impact on company performance, including the implementation of technological innovations (Mulligan ef al., 2021).

[...]digital leaders can influence techno work engagement (TE) through their role models as role models, the transmission of positive emotions, and the ability to provide attention, offer the help employees need, and distribute the necessary resources (Yu and Moon, 2021).

[...]there are still few scholars who have researched the interaction between important elements in Digital Innovation (DI), Digital Leadership (DL), Innovative Culture (IC), technology work involvement (TE), and technological stress inhibitors (TsI).

[...]to add literature on management in general and digital technology in MSMEs in particular, this study aims to investigate the influence of digital leadership, technostress inhibitors, and innovation culture on the performance of Digital Innovation (Heubeck and Meckl, 2022).

T1  - Nurse Managers’ Perspectives on Digital Transformation and Informatics Competencies in E-Leadership: A Qualitative Study
AN  - 3236023530
AB  - Aim: To explore nurse managers’ perspectives on the competencies required for effective e-leadership in the context of healthcare digital transformation.Background: As healthcare systems adopt digital technologies, nurse managers must acquire informatics and leadership competencies to navigate evolving responsibilities, improve team performance, and enhance care quality.Methods: A qualitative descriptive design was used at a major Saudi hospital. Semistructured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 42 nurse managers between 2023 and 2024. Data were analyzed thematically using Braun and Clarke’s six-step approach.Results: Participants were predominantly female (90.5%) and Saudi nationals (52.4%), with most aged 40–50 years. While all held at least a bachelor’s degree, 61.9% had a master’s qualification. Most had 5–10 years of managerial experience, though 61.9% reported lacking digital leadership training. Thematic analysis identified six key themes: digital transformation, e-leadership, e-leadership competencies (knowledge, skills, and attitudes), self-efficacy evaluation, barriers, and recommendations. Participants recognized the transformative role of digital tools but cited challenges such as limited training, infrastructure constraints, and hierarchical resistance.Conclusion: Nurse managers acknowledged the need for enhanced digital literacy, technical proficiency, and a positive attitude toward change. Strengthening these competencies is essential for leading digital innovation and supporting healthcare reform initiatives such as Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.Implications for Nursing Management: Healthcare organizations should invest in structured leadership development, mentorship, and academic-practice partnerships to equip nurse managers with the skills and confidence to lead digital transformation effectively.

T1  - Digital Transformation in Patient Organizations: Interview and Focus Group Study
AN  - 3222368410
AB  - Background:Patient organizations (POs) are an integral part of the health care landscape, serving as advocates and support systems for patients and their families. As the digitalization of health care accelerates, POs are challenged to adapt their diverse roles to digital formats. However, the extent and form of POs’ digital adaptation and the challenges POs encounter in their digital transformation remain unexplored.Objective:This study aims to investigate the digital transformation processes within POs. We examined the types of digital activities and processes implemented, people involved in respective tasks, challenges encountered, and attitudes toward the digitalization of POs.Methods:The study was carried out by the multicenter interdisciplinary research network Pandora. We adopted a qualitative exploratory approach by conducting 37 semistructured interviews and 2 focus groups with representatives and members of POs in Germany. Results were obtained using a deductive-inductive approach based on a qualitative content analysis. Methods and results were reported in accordance with the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) checklist.Results:POs primarily apply basic digital tools to engage in communication, health education, and information dissemination. Some also develop specific mobile apps and collect health data through patient registries. Volunteers cover a considerable part of the workload. Sometimes, POs collaborate with external partners, such as health professionals or other nonprofit organizations. Furthermore, many (13/46, 28%) interviewees referred to the importance of involving members in digitalization efforts to better meet their needs. However, they described the actual practices used to involve members in, for example, developing digital services as limited, passive, or implicit. When evaluating digital transformation processes, representatives and members of POs expressed generally positive attitudes and acknowledged their potential to improve the accessibility of support services, management efficiency, and outreach. Still, resource constraints; the complexity of digital initiatives; and accessibility issues for certain demographic groups, especially older persons, were frequently mentioned as challenges. Several (15/46, 33%) interviewees highlighted POs’ increasing responsibility to support their members’ digital competencies and digital health literacy.Conclusions:POs are actively involved in the digital transformation of health services. To navigate challenges and further shape and sustain digital activities and processes, POs may benefit from governance frameworks, that is, a clear plan outlining with whom, how, and with what objectives digital projects are being realized. Support from public, scientific, and policy institutions to enhance the process through training, mentorship, and fostering collaborative networks seems warranted.

T1  - The Effect of Resource Restructuring on Supply Chain Resilience in the Context of Digital Transformation
AN  - 3212132189
AB  - In the BANI context, organizations can utilize digital technologies to implement flexible resource allocation strategies to help them address unpredictable situations, which is crucial for enhancing supply chain resilience. However, the existing research lacks an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms underlying supply chain resilience development in the practice of enterprise resource restructuring. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate how companies can enhance supply chain resilience through resource restructuring in the context of digital transformation. Taking Compaks as its research object, this study adopted the exploratory single-case study method. Through open, axial, and selective coding based on the proceduralized grounded theory and following the research logic of “resource orchestration motivation—digital transformation—resource orchestration under digital transformation”, this study comprehensively investigates the improvement of supply chain resilience via enterprise resource restructuring in the context of digital transformation. The results show that (1) resource orchestration motivation includes two dimensions of risk perception, supply-side and demand-side (2) in the context of digital transformation, restructuring supply chain resources (redundant, technological, and internal and external resources) through capability transformation (manufacturing, digital platform, and innovation capability) positively impacts supply chain resilience (both active and passive). This research contributes to the theory of supply chain resilience and provides reference and guidance for traditional enterprise resource orchestration and optimizing supply chain resilience.

T1  - The Impact of Accounting Digital Transformation on Financial Transparency: Mediating Role of Good Governance
AN  - 3212027129
AB  - Accounting digital transformation in today’s fast-digitizing banking environment is becoming an imperative force driving transparency and governance in the banking industry. This study explores the effect of accounting digital transformation on transparency in finance, with emphasis on the mediating effect of good governance in Jordan’s commercial banking. Based on survey data from 386 bank experts, the study utilizes Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to analyze the relationships among organizational, technical, and human dimensions of digital transformation, governance, as well as financial transparency. The findings show that all three dimensions have positive impacts on transparency in finance, and good governance partially mediates these relationships. These insights provide policy makers and practising managers with actionable advice to enhance financial reporting through governance and digitization.

T1  - Insurance sector readiness for digital transformation: Empirical evidence from Jordan
AN  - 3201738972
AB  - The significance of companies’ readiness for digital transformation is becoming more widely recognized. This study, focusing on insurance companies in Jordan, aims to investigate the impact of organizational readiness on digital transformation. The study participants were staff members from various departments and administrative levels within the insurance companies, and the study population included all insurance companies in Jordan. This study uses convenience sampling to gather the required data by distributing an online questionnaire of 39 questions. A total of 245 valid responses were received and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results of the study prove that change valence positively influences digital transformation. The results also show that change efficacy, incorporating resource, IT, and cognitive readiness, positively affect digital transformation. Moreover, the results confirm that contextual factors incorporating cultural, strategic, and partnership readiness positively impact digital transformation. Further, employees’ work experience moderates the relationships between organizational readiness constructs and digital transformation. These results indicate that the insurance companies in Jordan should implement a comprehensive approach that encompasses an organizational rehabilitation strategy.

T1  - Research on Digital Transformation and the Innovation Model of SMMEs: The Case Study of PAYA
AN  - 3194644184
AB  - The rapid development of digital technology has prompted many enterprises to carry out digital transformation. For SMMEs (small- and medium-sized equipment manufacturing enterprises), digital transformation is not only a necessary measure to deal with changes in the external environment but also a key opportunity to stimulate the vitality of internal innovation. At the same time, the digital transformation of SMMEs and a series of innovation activities caused by it, as well as the various innovation models that have evolved from it, are closely related to managerial cognition. On the premise that digital transformation is regarded as an enterprise innovation activity, this study discusses the ways in which digital transformation drives the innovation model of SMMEs. Taking PAYA as the research object, combined with the theory of resource orchestration, this study adopts the longitudinal single-case study method to explore the connotation and operation logic of the SMME innovation model and constructs a theoretical “digital transformation-innovation-innovation” model. The key findings of the research are as follows: Firstly, innovation models experience a phased evolution. Digital transformation promotes the innovation of SMMEs through three stages: digital technology structuring single-agent innovation, digital technology bundling dual-agent innovation, and digital technology leveraging multi-agent innovation. Secondly, the role of managerial cognition is pivotal. Managerial cognition is the core driving force promoting the digital transformation and innovation of enterprises. Digital transformation, in turn, enables enterprises to continuously accumulate digital technology and digital resources, guiding them from internal single-subject innovation to dual-subject innovation, and ultimately forming a multi-subject innovation model. Thirdly, resource orchestration is a dynamic mechanism. Digital transformation promotes the evolution of enterprise innovation models through resource assembly, resource integration, and resource collaboration. This process not only optimizes the allocation of internal resources within the enterprise but also amplifies the scale effect of innovation through collaboration with external partners. Theoretically, this study aims to enrich the understanding of digital transformation in the context of innovation models for SMMEs. It particularly sheds light on the formation logic of innovation models during the digital transformation process, thereby filling a gap in the existing literature. At the practical level, it will have a certain reference value for the “empowering” and “enabling” processes involved in the digital transformation of SMMEs. It also provides practical guidance for SMMEs on how to achieve innovation during the digital transformation process.

T1  - Research on the Impact of Green Supply Chain Integration on Enterprises’ Green Innovation
AN  - 3188886930
AB  - Purpose: The objective of this study is to examine the influences of green supply chain integration, digital transformation of the supply chain, and environmental uncertainty on corporate green innovation. Moreover, relevant policy suggestions are put forward to facilitate the sustainable development of corporate green innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the literature research method to sort out variables to understand the current situation as the foundation for our study, uses the questionnaire survey method to create a questionnaire to collect data, and analyzes the data with the help of the empirical research method to verify our hypotheses to draw conclusions. Findings: Green supply chain integration positively promotes corporate green innovation and also positively affects supply chain digital transformation, which in turn positively promotes corporate green innovation. Moreover, supply chain digital transformation acts as a mediator, while environmental uncertainty plays a moderating role and affects green supply chain integration and green innovation. Originality/value: This study delves into how green supply chain integration, with green internal integration, green supplier integration, and green customer integration as its independent variables, affects the green innovation of domestic manufacturing enterprises. By doing so, it breaks new ground for empirical research in this area and offers theoretical directions for the green innovation efforts of enterprises. Meanwhile, in the digital era, from the overall supply chain perspective, we break through the limitations of previously studied intermediary variables. We construct a theoretical model by integrating supply chain digital transformation and environmental uncertainty variables and explore the variable influence paths. This can fill the research gaps, lay a solid theoretical groundwork for enhancing enterprise sustainable development, and open a new path for enterprise growth.

T1  - The Impact of Digital Technology, Automation, and Data Integration on Supply Chain Performance: Exploring the Moderating Role of Digital Transformation
AN  - 3181498032
AB  - Background: This study investigates digital transformation as a moderating variable in determining the effect of digital technologies, automation, and data integration of upstream and downstream providers on supply chain performance. By filling the existing research gap, the study reveals that more research regarding how digital transformation interventions impact the effectiveness of these technologies for industrial supply chains must be understood. Methods: A structured survey was applied to 181 supply chain managers in manufacturing firms scattered across Jordan. Results: The findings using SmartPLS for statistical analysis indicated that automation has the strongest positive effect on supply chain performance, followed by data integration. But digital technology did not have a significant direct effect, unless it was accompanied by broader digital transformation initiatives. Conclusions: Theoretically, this study reinforces digital transformation theory as a vital framework, whereas in practice, it invokes the strategic deployment of automation and integrated data application designs to underpin supply chain efficiency and competitiveness. Finally, this study offers practical guidance for practitioners who seek to employ the use of digital transformation in the current dynamic business environment.

T1  - How Does Digital Transformation Improve Supply Chain Performance: A Manufacturer’s Perspective
AN  - 3037629494
AB  - A prominent research area pertains to the integration of digital technologies in corporate frameworks and their strategic utilization. In particular, as both intercompany dependencies in business activities and environmental uncertainty increase, digital transformation has become an important means of managing transaction relationships not only within but also between companies. The purpose of this study is to explicate the process of how digital transformation technology used among supply chain members can improve corporate performance and to identify the influencing variables for making good use of it. The findings have implications that can help companies invest time and money in digital innovation to achieve effective corporate performance. This research model analyzed data from 222 domestic manufacturing companies through structural equation model analysis. We found that the more developed the corporate culture and the higher the trust with partner companies, the more active the companies are in utilizing digital transformation. In addition, while digital transformation has a direct impact on corporate performance, we also confirmed the mediating effect of information sharing between companies, which can have a greater positive impact on corporate performance as its level increases. A notable result is that digital transformation significantly improves information sharing in low-trust corporate relationships. These results suggest that digital, non-face-to-face technologies can complement and strengthen relationships that have traditionally been formed through interpersonal relationships. This study compensates for the shortcomings of previous studies that verify the fragmentary achievements of digital transformation. It also has theoretical significance in that it hypothesizes and demonstrates the entire process of how digital transformation is activated in what type of environment and leads to corporate performance. In addition, although companies with a strong relationship of trust may find it easy to invest in innovation, there are practical implications that even new companies that do not have a relationship of trust should consider active use of digital transformation when conducting important transactions.
