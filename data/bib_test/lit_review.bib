	abstract = {PurposeIn the era of digital transformation, digital innovation has
   emerged as a crucial driver of competitiveness and growth. However,
   limited knowledge exists on how digital innovation diffuses across
   supply chains, particularly in the manufacturer-distributor
   relationship. Drawing upon diffusion of innovation theory and social
   network theory, this study aims to examine how manufacturers' digital
   innovation impacts distributors' digital innovation, focusing on the
   moderating roles of cooperation length and network status of
   manufacturers and distributors.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses
   a sample of 233 manufacturer-distributor pairs from the Chinese
   paper-making industry. Geographically, the survey comprises sample firms
   nationwide, covering most regions and provinces in China.FindingsThe
   authors find that manufacturers' digital innovation positively affects
   distributors' digital innovation. This relationship is strengthened by
   cooperation length and manufacturers' network status but dampened by
   distributors' network status. The findings provide insights into how
   digital innovation diffuses across supply chain partners and highlight
   the importance of social relationships and network positions in this
   digital innovation diffusion process.Originality/valueThis study makes a
   significant contribution to the field of supply chain management by
   offering deep insights into the diffusion of digital innovation across
   supply chain partners. It highlights the significance of social
   relationships and network positions in the process of digital innovation
   diffusion, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between
   manufacturers and distributors in the context of digital transformation.},

	abstract = {In order to address the challenges of digital transformation in
   data-driven enterprises resulting from edge computing, an efficient
   resource pricing strategy for edge service providers (ESPs) is
   essential. This paper introduces a novel resource pricing and management
   system for ESPs, termed the ``edge bank,{''} which models edge nodes in
   resource pricing as borrowers and lenders analogous to a commercial
   bank. We investigate two key issues within this edge bank system: (1)
   the operational mechanism of the edge bank, and (2) the resource pricing
   and management strategy employed by the edge bank for ESPs. To address
   the first issue, we present an implementation framework for resource
   pricing and management within the edge bank system. For the second
   issue, we propose a two-stage resource pricing strategy based on game
   theory, tailored to the system's characteristics, which consists of an
   initial stage and a steady stage. Additionally, we develop a price
   adjustment algorithm that optimizes the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) in
   the edge bank system. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the two-stage pricing strategy and highlight the superior performances
   of proposed algorithm to enhance resource utilization for ESPs.},

@article{WOS:001276964900001,
	abstract = {This paper analyses the factors that determine the process of digital
   transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To this
   end, digital transformation is conceptually approached as an innovation
   process in a company that affects its products and processes. The
   proposed theoretical framework integrates, from a holistic perspective,
   three dimensions in the digital transformation process in SMEs: (1) the
   technological dimension; (2) the human capital dimension; and (3) the
   organizational/relational dimension. Furthermore, these dimensions
   manifest themselves at three levels of analysis: (a) the
   entrepreneur/manager; (b) the firm; and (c) the environment external to
   the firm. The empirical research presented in this paper is based on a
   representative survey of SMEs in Spain. The results highlight that both
   internal skills and external sources of knowledge regarding information
   and communication technology (ICT) through consultants, suppliers,
   universities and technological centers constitute critical and
   complementary drivers for digital innovation in SMEs. The analysis also
   reveals the importance of an explicit digital transformation strategy in
   the company and the distribution of responsibilities regarding
   digitalization beyond the leadership of the entrepreneur/manager.
   Likewise, the complex use of the Internet by entrepreneurs/managers is
   observed to favor digital product innovation, whereas their growth
   ambition stimulates digital process innovation. The results also
   indicate that the relevance of the aforementioned determinants varies
   somewhat for microenterprises compared to other SMEs.},

	abstract = {Purpose The rapid advancement of digital technologies has fundamentally
   changed the competitive dynamics of the logistics service industry and
   forced incumbent logistics service providers (LSPs) to digitalize. As
   many LSPs still struggle in advancing their digital transformation (DT),
   the purpose of this study is to discover barriers and identify
   organizational elements and associated leading practices for DT success
   at LSPs. Design/methodology/approach This study utilizes a two-stage
   approach. Stage 1 is devoted to a literature review. Stage 2, based on
   multiple case studies, analyzes information collected across nine
   international and global LSPs. Findings This research derives a
   practice-based definition of DT in the logistics service industry, and
   it has identified five barriers, eight success factors and associated
   leading practices for DT. The main obstacles LSPs struggle with, are the
   complexity of the logistics network and lack of resources, while the
   main success factor is a leader having and executing a DT vision, and
   creating a supportive organizational culture. Practical implications The
   results contribute to the emerging field of DT within the logistics and
   supply chain management literature and provide insights for
   practitioners regarding how to effectively implement it in a complex
   industry. Originality/value The authors analyze DT from the perspective
   of LSPs, traditionally not viewed as innovative companies. This study
   compares their DT with that of other companies.},

	abstract = {Digitisation has opened up powerful new ways for multinational
   enterprises (MNEs) to connect with global markets, resources and
   partners and to pursue innovation in foreign markets. While the unique
   characteristics of digital technologies and digital assets embody an
   expansive and promising global landscape for innovation, MNEs' success
   in pursuing such digital innovation will also be shaped by the nature
   and extent of localization forces prevalent in different foreign
   markets, an issue that has received limited attention in both digital
   innovation and international business literatures. In this short essay,
   I highlight this gap and call for the study of digital innovation in the
   international business context by bringing together ideas, theories and
   concepts from both areas. I draw on and combine two perspectives-one
   drawn from the innovation literature (digital innovation as recombinant
   innovation involving digital assets) and the other from the
   international business literature (the international business context as
   being defined by national policies and regulations, infrastructure and
   culture) and suggest several promising themes and questions for future
   research in this area, specifically relating to how
   globalization/localization forces facilitate/hinder MNEs' global digital
   innovation efforts. I hope the call made here will be answered by
   scholars from both fields and lead to insights that enrich both theory

   addition, the effect of learning orientation is considered as a
   moderator that strengthens the relationship between market orientation
   implementation and market orientation internalization. The research
   model is empirically tested using Hayes (2013) conditional process
   analysis utilizing a unique dataset from an industry that is undergoing
   an unprecedented digital transformation from physical to digital

	abstract = {Digital transformation is among the most pervasive forces disrupting
   business models across every industrial sector. While prior research has
   explored the digital transformation of business models, the effect on
   the value proposition as a key element of the business model has
   received only limited attention. Drawing on an extensive single case
   study in the regional media industry involving 59 interviews with one
   service provider and its customers, this study explores the digital
   transformation of the provider's value proposition and how this process
   was collectively enacted by the provider and its customers. This study
   develops an empirically grounded framework illustrating the key value
   proposition transformation drivers, provider and customer sense-making
   practices, and value element reshaping implications. Overall, this study
   advances contemporary digital transformation and value proposition
   research by demonstrating how the process of digital transformation
   changes the nature and content of the value proposition and how managers
   can facilitate this process.},

	abstract = {Because of the rising labor costs and the trade impact after joining the
   World Trade Organization, the textile industry in Taiwan has encountered
   many operational and production problems and obstacles. In addition, the
   lack of knowledge and resources for the digital transformation required
   to improve business performance has led to poor production and
   decision-making efficiency, and stagnant R\&D for textile product
   innovation. In order to improve business operations, enhance customer
   satisfaction and experience, increase efficiency and reduce manual
   error, this study was conducted with senior executives and company
   managers in Taiwan's textile industry as the target population. The
   knowledge, technological resources, and competitive pressure of digital
   transformation are the independent variables. The organizational
   innovation atmosphere is the moderating variable. The study analyzes the
   impact of digital transformation on the intention of enterprises. The
   results of the study show that the knowledge of digital transformation,
   technological resources, and the competitive pressure of the textile
   industry positively and significantly affect their perceived benefits of
   digital transformation. Digital transformation knowledge, technological
   resources, and competitive pressure will negatively and significantly
   affect the perceived risk of digital transformation. The perceived
   benefits and risks of digital transformation are related to the
   intention of digital transformation of enterprises. The organizational
   innovation atmosphere of the textile industry positively moderates the
   influence of perceived benefits on digital transformation intention.
   Finally, based on the research findings, this study provides practical
   recommendations to senior executives and company managers in the textile
   industry. It is also recommended to promote the digital transformation
   of related software and hardware vendors and government agencies, as
   well as the subsequent related research reference.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades, digital transformation has been critical for
   firms' survival and development. Thus, it is important to understand
   what factors might help facilitate firms' digital transformation. We
   investigate this problem in the supply chain context by examining
   whether and how a supplier's major customers influence its digital
   transformation. Using a sample of Chinese public firms from 2007 to
   2020, we document that major customers' level of digital transformation
   is positively associated with their supplier's level of digital
   transformation, and the effect is more pronounced when customers are of
   greater importance to suppliers. The finding holds to a battery of
   robustness tests. Cross-sectional tests reveal that the impact of
   customers' digital transformation on suppliers' digital transformation
   is stronger for suppliers with technology-experienced executives, more
   high-skilled labor, fewer financial constraints, and narrower digital
   gap. Moreover, suppliers headquartered in regions with more digital
   infrastructure also show a more pronounced effect. Further analyses show
   that the underlying channels through which customers impact their
   supplier's digital transformation are knowledge transfer and market
   competition. Finally, we show that suppliers' digital transformation
   helps increase innovation outcomes. Overall, our paper extends prior
   literature on the real effects of customer-supplier relationships on
   suppliers' digital investment decisions.},

   from 2007 to 2021 as a research sample, this study examines the impact
   of sharing auditors with customers on the digital transformation of
   suppliers.Results The results show that sharing auditors with customers
   can promote suppliers' digital transformation, and this promotion effect
   is stronger among suppliers with weaker bargaining power, lower media
   attention, and higher auditor industry expertise. In terms of the
   mechanism of action, sharing auditors with customers can help strengthen
   the supplier's supervision, alleviate suppliers' financing constraints,
   and thus facilitate their digital transformation. Further research finds
   that when suppliers share auditors with their customers, suppliers'
   digital transformation helps promote innovation.Discussion The research
   conclusion provides effective empirical evidence for alleviating the
   dilemma of digital transformation of enterprises.},

   2009-2020, we examine how customer concentration would influence firms'
   digital transformation. In this study, we construct a proxy for digital
   transformation based on a text analysis approach. Our baseline results
   show that customer concentration hinders digital transformation at the
   firm level. Moreover, we design a series of tests including instrumental
   variables and 2SLS regression to mitigate the endogeneity concern.
   Still, we find results consistent with the baseline regression. The
   results hold after multiple robustness tests. Furthermore, this negative
   effect of customer concentration on digital transformation is more
   pronounced when firms are subject to 1) more market competition, 2) more
   financing constraints, 3) higher transaction costs, and 4) less
   efficient use of resources. Overall, our results demonstrate the role of

   and across industrial sectors to study how the configuration of alliance
   portfolios in terms of size, degree of exploration, internationality,

   find that alliances appear to be an effective means, yet alliances for

   portfolios help with the creation of digital innovations while

	abstract = {PurposeDigital transformation misalignment refers to disparities in
   digital transformation levels between suppliers and buyers across the
   production and operation process. It has negatively affected supply
   chain stability. However, the existing research concerning the economic
   consequences has not been adequately addressed. Therefore, this paper
   aims to investigate whether such digital transformation misalignment
   increases supplier financial risk and to identify the factors
   influencing this relationship.Design/methodology/approachThis paper
   examines binary combinations of suppliers and buyers listed on China's
   A-share market between 2011 and 2021. This group constitutes a sample to
   empirically test the influence of digital transformation misalignment on
   the supplier's financial risk, as well as the moderating effect of the
   geographical and organizational distances.FindingsThe paper's findings
   demonstrate that digital transformation misalignment has indeed a
   significant increase in the supplier's financial risk. Moreover, the
   impact is more intense when the geographical or organizational distance
   between the supplier and the buyer is relatively
   large.Originality/valueThe existing literature rarely explores the
   potential risks arising from digital transformation misalignment between
   supply chain partners. Therefore, this paper fills a notable gap as it
   is the first to study the impact of digital transformation misalignment
   on the supplier's financial risk and the specific applied mechanisms.
   The contribution significantly improves the field of corporate digital
   transformation, particularly, within the context of supply chain
   management.},

	abstract = {A prominent research area pertains to the integration of digital
   technologies in corporate frameworks and their strategic utilization. In
   particular, as both intercompany dependencies in business activities and
   environmental uncertainty increase, digital transformation has become an
   important means of managing transaction relationships not only within
   but also between companies. The purpose of this study is to explicate
   the process of how digital transformation technology used among supply
   chain members can improve corporate performance and to identify the
   influencing variables for making good use of it. The findings have
   implications that can help companies invest time and money in digital
   innovation to achieve effective corporate performance. This research
   model analyzed data from 222 domestic manufacturing companies through
   structural equation model analysis. We found that the more developed the
   corporate culture and the higher the trust with partner companies, the
   more active the companies are in utilizing digital transformation. In
   addition, while digital transformation has a direct impact on corporate
   performance, we also confirmed the mediating effect of information
   sharing between companies, which can have a greater positive impact on
   corporate performance as its level increases. A notable result is that
   digital transformation significantly improves information sharing in
   low-trust corporate relationships. These results suggest that digital,
   non-face-to-face technologies can complement and strengthen
   relationships that have traditionally been formed through interpersonal
   relationships. This study compensates for the shortcomings of previous
   studies that verify the fragmentary achievements of digital
   transformation. It also has theoretical significance in that it
   hypothesizes and demonstrates the entire process of how digital
   transformation is activated in what type of environment and leads to
   corporate performance. In addition, although companies with a strong
   relationship of trust may find it easy to invest in innovation, there
   are practical implications that even new companies that do not have a
   relationship of trust should consider active use of digital
   transformation when conducting important transactions.},

	abstract = {The healthcare industry is continuously evolving with innovative
   discoveries and therapies, and at the same time, there is a decline in
   the research and development productivity leading to an increased cost
   for payers, providers, and patients. Despite the benefits that digital
   technologies can have on healthcare innovation, such a highly regulated
   industry often relies on proven-established technologies and
   organizational procedures that can be at odds with the new logics of
   digital innovation. In this article, we will be introducing a digital

   innovations in a phase-appropriate and incremental setup (e.g., scale,
   costs, risks, value evaluations, policies, and resources). The framework
   is designed and validated through an iterative process of continuous
   adaptation with local practices in a biopharmaceutical company. DIM
   provides practical guidance to drive digital innovations that entail
   different logics compared to traditional innovations, by improving the
   visibility of the digital innovation process and increasing

	abstract = {The advent of the digital economy has ushered in a new era of digital
   innovation. Given that dependence on key suppliers significantly affects
   focal firms' behavior and decision-making, it still remains unclear
   whether concentrated suppliers impede or facilitate focal firms' digital
   innovation. Drawing upon resource dependence theory, this study aims to
   explore how supplier concentration influences focal firms' digital
   innovation. Furthermore, since internal resources can alter the
   dependency between focal firms and suppliers, this study introduces the
   tangible resources represented by slack resource and intangible
   resources represented by human capital as mechanisms to mitigate firms'
   dependence on key suppliers. Using a dataset of 2,347 unique Chinese
   listed manufacturing firms from 2008 to 2020, we empirically reveal a
   negative impact of supplier concentration on digital innovation.
   Further, we discover that operational slack, technical experience in top
   management teams (TMTs), and employee education background mitigate the
   negative influence of supplier concentration on digital innovation.
   Surprisingly, the direct moderating role of financial slack is not
   significant, but the additional analysis indicates that the moderating
   effect of operational slack is strengthened in firms with high financial
   slack. Robustness tests reaffirm these findings. This study extends the
   growing digital innovation literature and provides actionable insights
   for firms to effectively leverage their resources to pursue digital
   innovation in situations of high supplier concentration.},

	abstract = {PurposeThe rapid advancement of digital technologies compels companies
   across all industries to develop new capabilities to foster innovation
   and sustain competitiveness. Consequently, scholarly debates have
   intensified regarding how these new capabilities contribute to
   companies' innovation endeavors. This study addresses this imperative by
   exploring two primary research questions: first, identifying the
   essential organizational capabilities for digital innovation; and
   second, examining how these capabilities facilitate innovation. The
   objective is to develop a comprehensive conceptual framework that
   classifies digital innovation capability as a higher-order
   organizational capacity, offering valuable insights for both academic
   scholarship and practical applications in digital innovation management.
   Design/methodology/approachUsing a qualitative approach, this study
   combines a systematic literature review with grounded theory principles
   to analyze 38 empirical papers from Scopus and Web of Science databases.
   The rigorous multi-stage coding process - open, axial and selective
   coding - facilitated the identification and synthesis of valuable
   insights for digital innovation capabilities. This approach ensures a
   comprehensive yet focused review, supporting the development of a robust
   theoretical framework. FindingsFour critical capability clusters were
   identified to shape digital innovation capabilities: sensing,
   analytic-driven, digital platform and orchestration. Sensing
   capabilities enhance environmental awareness and enable organizations to
   detect market needs and opportunities, fostering customer-centric
   innovations. Analytic-driven capabilities leverage data for insightful
   decision-making and trend analysis. Digital platform capabilities
   highlight the strategic use of technological infrastructures to enable
   collaborative innovation, integrating diverse capabilities and
   objectives. Orchestration capabilities focus on effective coordination
   of resources and partnerships, ensuring sustained digital innovation by
   bridging capability gaps and reconfiguring resources. Collectively,
   these clusters offer a holistic framework for excelling in the dynamic
   digital innovation landscape. Originality/valueWhile previous literature
   has focused on the impact of individual capabilities on digital
   innovation, this study offers a novel and integrative framework that
   categorizes digital innovation capabilities into four distinct yet
   interconnected clusters: sensing, analytic-driven, digital platforms and
   orchestration. This framework delineates the unique roles each
   capability plays in the digital innovation process. By synthesizing
   empirical studies and constructing a robust theoretical framework, this
   research significantly contributes to both academic scholarship and
   practical applications, offering essential strategies for organizations
   to enhance their digital innovation efforts through sustainable
   capability development.},

	abstract = {Insufficient motivation and limited capacity hinder enterprises' digital
   transformation. However, research regarding whether an enterprise's
   digital transformation benefits from supply chain relationships is scant
   remains unexplored. From a vertical cooperation perspective, we find
   that the digital transformation of focal enterprises promotes the
   digital transformation of upstream and downstream enterprises, with a
   greater spillover impact on upstream suppliers. The mechanism analysis
   indicates that the digital transformation of focal enterprises enhances
   suppliers' transformation motivation through a reverse driving effect.
   Moreover, it enhances the suppliers' transformation ability through
   knowledge spillover and financing constraint effects, though the latter
   does not extend to customers. Further study suggests that spillover
   effects vary across supply chain characteristics. Digital spillovers
   improve the production-marketing integration and innovation capacity of
   supply chains. This study provides novel insights into the dynamic
   interaction of supply chain systems and guides enterprises on utilizing

	abstract = {In recent years, research on issues such as health digitalization has
   been growing rapidly. This was partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic
   and its growing burden on healthcare systems. In this study, we use a
   bibliometric approach to map the research dealing with digital
   innovations in the health sector, identify key research areas, and
   reveal knowledge gaps related to this emerging research topic. We
   conduct a bibliometric analysis of 151 papers from January 2010 to
   January 2023, indexed in the SCOPUS database using the R bibliometrix
   package and VOSviewer software. We find that, since 2010, there has been
   a huge increase in the number of publications, and the United States and
   the United Kingdom were the most influential knowledge centers for
   research collaboration on digital health. We identify four clusters of
   research themes: (1) IT and telemedicine, (2) digital technologies and
   mental health, (3) health digitalization resulting from the COVID-19
   pandemic, (4) and digitalization, patients' safety or resilience. Our
   contributions help to map the knowledge structure on digital innovation
   in health and to highlight unresolved issues, such as the social
   implications of digital health adoption. Social issues related to
   digital transformation of the health sector could provide future
   research directions.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation is increasingly recognized as a key driver of
   sustainable development, enabling suppliers to improve efficiency,
   reduce resource consumption, and adapt to changing market demands.
   However, it remains a challenging process for suppliers, often hindered
   by resource and capacity constraints. This study investigates how
   government subsidies can facilitate supplier digital transformation,
   considering supply chain diffusion and local government competition
   dynamics. Using data from A-share listed companies in China between 2010
   and 2021, our analysis reveals that government subsidies significantly
   promote supplier digital transformation by encouraging a more
   diversified downstream customer base. Moreover, customer digital
   transformation can facilitate supplier digital transformation, but
   spillover effects are higher within the same jurisdiction than across
   different jurisdictions. This study further identifies that the impact
   of government subsidies is more pronounced under higher opportunistic
   risk but is constrained by systemic risk. Additionally, suppliers with
   higher human capital and a smaller digital divide with customers exhibit
   greater effectiveness in adopting innovation diffusion. These findings
   provide valuable insights into optimizing local government subsidies
   policies to enhance supplier digital transformation and contribute to
   the broader goal of sustainable development.},

	abstract = {In turbulent contexts, organizations face contradictory challenges which
   give rise to management tensions and paradoxes. Digital transformation
   is one such context where the disruptive potential of digital
   technologies demands radical responses from existing organizations.
   While prior research has recognized the importance of coping with
   organizational paradoxes, little is known about how to identify them.
   Although it may be apparent in some settings which paradoxes are at
   play, other more ambivalent contexts require explicit identification.
   This study takes a design perspective to identify the relevant paradoxes
   in a digital transformation context. It presents the results of a 2-year
   action design research study in collaboration with an organization that
   chose to explicitly focus on paradoxical tensions for managing its
   digital transformation. The study's main contribution is twofold: (1) it
   presents design knowledge to identify organizational paradoxes; (2) it
   provides a better understanding of the organizational paradoxes involved
   in digital transformation. The design knowledge will help others to
   identify paradoxes when working with an organization and highlights
   dynamic and collaborative aspects of the identification process. The
   study also enhances the descriptive understanding of digital
   transformation paradoxes by showing the importance of learning and
   belonging tensions and by expressing a different view on what knowledge
   about paradoxes is, and how it is created and used.},

	abstract = {Digital technology has been raising the competition between banks and
   other financial service providers, and encourages banks to undergo
   digital transformation and introduce innovation in their products and
   services. However, the high investment required cannot be ignored when
   undergoing the digital transformation. A few research studies have
   examined the digital transformation effects on bank's financial
   performance. This research aims to examine the digital transformation's
   effect on bank profitability, specifically on banks with digital
   business models. Using digital banks' profitability as the object is the
   novelty of this study, whereas previous research on bank profitability
   focused solely on traditional banks. This research utilizes the Panel of
   Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and the panel data from 2016 to
   February 2023 of the digital business model bank population in
   Indonesia, which consists of seven banks. The result of the analysis
   indicates the U-shape relationship between digital transformation and
   bank profitability, as the digital transformation significantly supports
   the bank's profitability in the long run, while it causes profitability
   deterioration in the short run due to the huge IT investment. This study
   recommends that banks need to consider the cost of IT investment as well
   as the required time and optimum strategy in undergoing the digital
   transformation and achieving targeted profitability.},

	abstract = {Despite the large amount of touted benefits of digital innovation to
   contemporary firms, scholarly attention to how digital innovation may
   take place within an organization is surprisingly limited. Drawing upon
   issue selling theory, this study examines how chief information officers
   (CIOs) could lead their organizations' digital innovation initiatives.
   We propose that the CIO's issue selling effectiveness, rather than his
   or her structural position, directly influences the level of
   organizational digital innovation success. Furthermore, the CIO's
   structural power should not be overlooked because it could amplify
   (i.e., positively moderate) the impact of CIO issue selling to digital
   innovation outcomes. In addition, we identify four enabling forces of
   CIO issue selling effectiveness: (1) CIO strategic decision making
   authority, (2) CIO/top management team partnership, (3) CIO information
   technologies (IT)-related strategic knowledge, and (4) CIO political
   savvy. Matched-pair survey data collected from senior business and IT
   executives of 179 organizations largely support the research hypotheses.
   The findings of the study suggest that issue selling perspective offers
   a powerful theoretical lens to examine CIO strategic impacts in the

	abstract = {The competitive and cooperative relationships between suppliers and
   enterprises have important implications for enterprise strategy and
   operational decisions. Using data from listed manufacturing companies in
   China from 2007 to 2020, this paper empirically examines the impact of
   supplier concentration on corporate risk taking and its underlying
   mechanism. The results support the cooperative view of industrial
   organizations in a supply chain, which states that the higher the
   supplier concentration, the greater the level of corporate risk taking.
   The results are robust to various measures of the supplier concentration
   (Supply), sample selectivity bias, and endogeneity tests. This paper
   also shows that digital transformation has a moderating effect on
   supplier concentration and corporate risk taking. The supplier
   concentration can significantly increase risk taking in companies that
   have implemented digital transformation, while the effect is not
   significant in companies that have not implemented digital
   transformation. The conclusions drawn from this study provide practical
   guidance on industrial organization relationship coordination and
   digital transformation, suggesting that the implementation of digital
   transformation can help a firm to establish and consolidate a good
   relationship with suppliers and improve operational efficiency.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information and communication
   technologies, digital transformation has already been underway in
   various fields around the world. In order to construct digital
   government and promote the modernization process of national management
   system and management capability, governments of different Countries
   have started the digital transition process. Government digital
   transformation has fascinated many experts and scholars, while there is
   little literature on the relations between digital transformation and
   government performance. Combining dynamic capability theory and
   cooperative agility variables, the analysis framework and corresponding
   structural equation model were constructed. An empirical study on the
   impact of digital transformation on government performance was made
   using systematic review and questionnaire survey materials. The results
   show that sensing capability, seizing capability, transformation
   capability and partnering agility have significant positive effects on
   government performance. Moreover, partnering agility plays a mediating
   role in the interactions of sensing capability, transformation
   capability and government performance variables. This paper enriches the
   research achievements in the field of government digital transformation
   and provides both theoretical and practical supports for the improvement
   of government performance.},

	abstract = {Digital technologies are transforming the automotive industry and
   disrupting traditional business models. New business opportunities
   related to Industry 4.0 are emerging, so companies must adapt to the new
   environment.
   The study presents an application of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative
   analysis (fsQCA) to analyze the future impact of digital transformation
   on business performance models and the different actors' satisfaction. A
   wide range of aspects and actors derived from the digital transformation
   process in the automotive industry are considered.
   The study covers connected and autonomous driving, mobility as a
   service, digital information sources in car purchasing, big data, etc.
   The disruptive effect of the gradual introduction of electric vehicles
   into the market is also considered, which is boosted by environmental
   policies on climate change and directives for the potential use of
   renewable energy sources to power electric vehicles.
   On the other hand, the study analyses the impacts of digital
   transformation on the automotive industry from the point of view of
   different actors, ranging from automobile manufacturers, service
   providers, public transportation providers, and consumers to
   governments.
   The methodology has been successfully applied to a complex case
   study-based empirical analysis. It presents a novel application of fsQCA
   to digital transformation in the automotive industry in Spain.
   The conclusions show that it is necessary to invest in adequate measures
   for adaptation to digital transformation, and manufacturers will end up
   having greater profits, productivity, and competitiveness. From the
   point of view of consumers, there will be access to more and better

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Digital technologies nowadays play a major role in innovation
   within the agri-food domain. The evolution of IT systems has currently
   arrived at a level that involves complex systems integration and
   business ecosystems in which many stakeholders in different roles are
   involved. A new paradigm for digital innovation is needed that copes
   with this increased complexity.OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an
   empirically informed framework for analysing and designing viable,
   sus-tainable digital innovation ecosystems in the agri-food
   domain.METHODS: The research is based on a series of European
   large-scale public-private innovation projects from 2011 to 2021 with a
   total budget of 73 M euro . They involved hundreds of stakeholders that
   were developing a large number of digital solutions through which a
   digital innovation ecosystem for agri-food was formed. In a
   lon-gitudinal study, a conceptual framework was used to analyse these
   projects and describe how the digital innovation ecosystem has
   developed. Lessons learnt are translated into a number of design
   principles and an organizational approach to foster digital innovation
   ecosystems in agri-food.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual
   framework consists of 6 key concepts: (i) innovation strategy, (ii)
   innovation organization, (iii) innovation network that contains (iv) the
   innovation process and (v) the innovation object and finally (vi) an
   innovation infrastructure. Along these 6 concepts, lessons learnt and in
   total 21 design principles are derived from analysing the projects
   forming a basis for the organizational framework. At the core of this
   framework is a lean multi-actor approach to trials and use case
   development interacting with a set of multidisciplinary activities: (i)
   developing a common technical collaboration infrastructure, (ii)
   identifying value streams with user engagement, (iii) engaging the right
   partners and stakeholders at the right time supported by strategic
   project planning and dynamic management. The most important conclusion
   is that effective, successful and quick use of appropriate IT in
   agri-food requires that actors should not be analysed in isolation from
   both their technological and business environment. Another consequence
   is that a `minimal viable ecosystem' only emerges after considerable
   time, resources and ingenuity is invested and may require outside
   (government) intervention.SIGNIFICANCE: Results from this paper can be
   used both by public and private stakeholders to diagnose and improve
   digital innovation projects and develop viable, sustainable digital
   innovation ecosystems in agri-food.},

	abstract = {The formulation and implementation of a digital transformation strategy
   (DTS) has become a key concern for many pre-digital organizations across
   traditional industries, but how such a strategy can be developed remains
   an open question. We used interpretive in-depth case study research to
   study how a European financial services provider has formulated and
   implemented a DTS. By focusing on the underlying processes and
   strategizing activities, we show that digital strategy making not only
   represents a break with the conventions of upfront strategic information
   systems (IS) planning, but reveals a new extreme of emergent strategy
   making. Specifically, we conclude that a DTS is continuously in the
   making, with no foreseeable end. By building on theory from IS
   strategizing and strategy-as-practice literature, we theorize an
   integrated process/activity model that characterizes DTS formulation and
   implementation in pre-digital organizations. Our model shows that the
   crafting of a DTS is a highly dynamic process involving iterating

	abstract = {In the digital era, green supply chain management (GSCM) is undergoing
   transformations associated with innovation and performance improvements.
   Manufacturers adopt these innovative GSCM practices, called green supply
   chain digital transformation (GSCDT), by applying emergent digital
   technologies to GSCM for specific purposes. This study identifies and
   develops GSCDT practices with support from the literature and case
   studies of six manufacturers with operational GSCDT in diversified
   industries to explore the practice adoption enablers of GSCDT and
   contingency factors for performance improvement through GSCDT for
   manufacturers. We analyze the emergence and adoption of GSCDT and find
   that the practices are: a) unevenly implemented among the five
   dimensions of GSCM; b) highly reliant on top management to coordinate
   internal coordination among organizational units; c) more intensive in
   manufacturing operations with large suppliers; and d) implemented at a
   higher level for external practices than for internal practices. Our
   research findings contribute to academic knowledge by unraveling
   critical factors that affect the digital transformation process in GSCM
   and managerial insights by identifying pathways for the successful
   adoption of GSCDT practices.},

	abstract = {Excessive supply chain concentration (SCC) introduces various risks, and
   the factors contributing to SCC are complex and have been rarely
   explored. This study examines the economic impact of digital
   transformation on supply chains by analysing data from China's A-share
   listed companies (2010-2021) using regression models. The findings
   demonstrate that digital transformation significantly reduces supply
   chain concentration and increases the firms' influence within the supply
   chain. The mechanism analysis shows that digital transformation makes
   firms more attractive to suppliers and customers, eases financing
   constraints, boosts firm reputation, and reduces SCC. The impact is more
   pronounced in firms facing higher environmental uncertainty or those
   positioned upstream in the supply chain. Except for blockchain, all five
   dimensions of digital transformation help to reduce SCC, thereby
   improving total factor productivity and economic growth. Digital
   transformation also creates a spillover effect, raising expectations for
   digital transformation and productivity among suppliers and customers.
   These findings have significant implications for understanding digital
   transformation practices and advancing supply chain management. The
   conclusions remain robust after various tests, including changes to the
   measures of variables and controls for reverse causality using lagged
   treatment and instrumental variables.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the role of accountants
   as advisors in professional services firms (PSFs), and it examines the
   impact of digital transformation on the work, knowledge and skills of
   accountants in their role as advisors in PSFs.
   Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using semi-structured
   interviews predominantly with partners in Australian PSFs, including the
   Big4 and directors of professional accounting bodies. Findings The
   findings show that accountants as advisors fill a critical role in PSFs
   as they represent substantial human capital for such firms. Accountants
   as advisors are a valuable strategic resource because of their unique
   capabilities in combining generic human capital with digital human
   capital and social capital resources. Some differences between the Big4
   and non-Big4 were found in terms of services offered that were
   attributable to the respective industry foci and resource availability.
   Practical implications The findings have broader implications for both
   the accounting profession and the education sector in terms of providing
   a better, and more overt, understanding of what the future holds for the
   accounting profession and the relevant knowledge and skills required.
   Also, recruiters and managers at PSFs are likely to benefit from the
   findings. Originality/value Evidence from PSFs provides insights into an
   evolutionary path for the accounting profession, and the knowledge and
   skills accountants need to work in that increasingly competitive domain,
   due to digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation strategy (DTS) involves redesigning various
   organisational operations to encompass digital technologies and achieve
   business objectives. In this study, we explored digital strategy and
   value creation shifts in omnichannel organisations that aimed to deliver
   seamless online and on-premises (dual-mode) customer experiences. Using
   comprehensive data on the gambling industry, we focused on the long-term
   effects of dynamic relationships among multiple DTS events over time.
   Building on digital strategy and value-creation theory, we observed and
   analysed organisational changes linked to technological shifts in
   omnichannel organisations during turbulent times and disruptions.
   Herein, we discuss the balance between online and on-premises service
   channels in terms of a DTS pathway, viewing it as a dual-mode
   value-creation process. By exploring this dual-mode value-creation
   process, we contribute to DTS theory and omnichannel operations.
   Furthermore, we enhance theory by unveiling the impact of shifting
   digital strategy perspectives on the transformation of omnichannel
   organisations in dynamic and disruptive business environments. We also
   present strategic propositions for planning and realising DTS
   requirements for omnichannel service providers in a broad context.},

   relationship between digital transformation and trade credit financing
   from an advantage acquisition perspective. Using financial and text data
   from the annual reports of Chinese listed companies from 2010-2020, we
   find that digital transformation has a significant promotion effect on
   firm trade credit financing. This result is robust after accounting for
   a series of endogeneity and other tests. A further examination reveals
   that operation efficiency, information transparency, and reputation are
   inducement mechanisms. We also find that the promotion effect is

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the role that
   communication, trust and digital transformation can play in the
   relationship between joint problem-solving and supply chain resilience.
   More specifically, the authors try to examine the possibility of digital
   transformation as a replacement for trust within a joint problem-solving
   context.
   Design/methodology/approach - Asurvey instrument was developed and
   administrated to manufacturing firms within the United Kingdom and the
   United States. Based on data collected from 291 senior managers,
   multiple linear regressions were conducted through a customized process
   model to test the proposed hypotheses.
   Findings - The results point to the actual impact of digital
   transformation being far more complicated than the initial benefits that
   it appears to bring within a supply chain. Thus, technology is only
   effective when applied within the right context. The authors showcase
   that the trio of digital transformation, trust and joint problem-solving
   can be highly valuable to establish supply chain resilience and that
   further investigation on the interrelationships between these concepts
   is warranted.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the growing literature
   focusing on the role that digital transformation can play in developing
   supply chain capabilities. It adds an early empirical insight on the
   role of technology and governance in joint problem-solving and supply
   chain resilience.},

	abstract = {This study explores suppliers' attitudes towards customer firms' digital
   transformation and its consequences from the perspective of trade
   credit. It finds that Chinese public firms with a higher level of
   digital transformation receive more trade credit from suppliers.
   Mechanism tests show that digital transformation improves firms'
   information environment and technical efficiency while reducing
   financial performance volatility. This, in turn, decreases the
   information asymmetry and default risks suppliers face, enhancing firms'
   access to trade credit from suppliers. Further analysis reveals that
   this effect is stronger in firms with larger sizes, higher market
   shares, stronger profitability, and lower bankruptcy risks and is more
   pronounced for firms headquartered in provinces with lower levels of
   social trust or weaker law enforcement. Finally, we highlight the
   economic outcomes of this effect by showing that receiving more trade
   credit helps firms alleviate financing constraints, reduce debt costs,
   and improve investment efficiency.},

	abstract = {While the dynamic capabilities framework discusses the sensing, seizing,
   and transformation capabilities of organisations, we lack knowledge of
   the specific dynamic capabilities of intermediaries that support
   collaborations leading to the digital transformation of small and medium
   enterprises (SMEs). The specific role of intermediaries supporting
   collaboration between SMEs and the ecosystem, the unique barriers
   confronted by SMEs, and the long-term focus required for digital
   transformation suggest that intermediaries should deploy specific
   dynamic capabilities. By conducting in-depth interviews with innovation
   intermediaries, SMEs, and other ecosystem actors in the Ostrobothnia
   region of Finland, we make three original contributions to the dynamic
   capability framework. First, while the literature has discussed spotting
   opportunities and bringing partners together as sensing dynamic
   capability, we make an original contribution by demonstrating the
   `ancillary opportunity spotting capability' of intermediaries. This
   includes intermediaries spotting opportunities to develop digital
   technologies to address business, environmental, or social challenges of
   ecosystem actors (e.g. developing carbon-neutral solutions) where SME
   digital transformation is only indirectly achieved: hence, this is
   described as an ancillary opportunity. Second, while the literature has
   discussed that the seizing capability involves exploiting opportunities
   by using resources, we identified that intermediaries leverage `business
   model co-creation capability' for seizing. This predominantly consists
   of them co-creating - with the stakeholders of SMEs (i.e. customers,
   suppliers, and competitors) - the business models of SMEs for digital
   transformation. Third, as a transformation capability, intermediaries
   leverage `ecosystem revamping capability' for continued and scaled-up
   SME digital transformation, the capabilities associated with which
   include altering opportunity and ecosystem structures, bridging
   inter-ecosystem collaborations, and deploying international best
   practices. Our finding has implications for intermediaries, SMEs, and
   policymakers keen to enhance SME digital transformation by enabling
   intermediaries to develop required dynamic capabilities.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation reshapes business operations, yet its impact on
   corporate innovation boundaries remains unclear. Although research has
   explored the impact of digital transformation on firm performance,
   understanding how it interacts with supply chain dynamics to shape
   innovation scope is limited, particularly in emerging economies. This
   study investigates how digital transformation affects innovation
   boundaries and the moderating roles of supply chain concentration and
   transparency. Analyzing panel data from Chinese listed companies between
   2007 and 2022, we employ multiple regression models and address
   endogeneity through instrumental variables and Heckman selection
   approaches. Results indicate that digital transformation considerably
   expands innovation boundaries, exacerbated by customer and supplier
   concentration. Supply chain transparency further amplifies this
   relationship, highlighting the value of information visibility. Notably,
   the impact of digital transformation is more pronounced in nonhigh-tech
   and nonheavily polluting industries, calling into question conventional
   wisdom about technology adoption benefits. These findings advance
   innovation management theory by demonstrating how supply chain
   characteristics shape firms' ability to leverage digital technologies
   for innovation, while offering practical insights for managers seeking

	abstract = {In the dynamic landscape of rapid change and the pervasive influence of
   the digital revolution, the discussion surrounding the impact of digital
   transformation on the innovation performance of firms has become a focal
   point of intense debate. This paper aims to contribute to the evolution
   and advancement of traditional organizations toward high-quality
   development by addressing this issue through the integration of
   technology into the framework, leveraging the resource-based theory. The
   study seeks to explore the influence of digital transformation on
   innovation performance, specifically examining the role of supplier
   concentration in this relationship. Additionally, we investigate the
   moderating effect of CEO financial experience on the association between
   digital transformation and innovation performance. Utilizing multiple
   regression methodologies and analyzing data from Chinese listed firms
   spanning the period from 2007 to 2022, our empirical findings reveal a
   direct positive relationship between digital transformation and
   innovation performance. Furthermore, the study uncovers an indirect
   pathway through which digital transformation enhances innovation
   performance by mitigating supplier concentration. Notably, the positive
   impact of digital transformation is amplified by a CEO's background in
   finance. Finally, the effect of digital transformation on innovation
   performance is particularly pronounced in sectors such as state-owned
   entities, advanced technology companies, large-scale businesses, and

	abstract = {Amidst rapidly evolving market conditions, relying solely on internal
   information and knowledge for innovation has proven inadequate. The
   emergence of the digital economy injected renewed vitality into
   enterprise innovation. However, existing studies have predominantly
   concentrated on the digital transformation intrinsic to enterprises,
   neglecting the impact of partners' digital transition on enterprises'
   innovation performance. From the perspective of supply chain spillovers,
   this study evaluates the influence of digital transitions in upstream
   and downstream enterprises on the innovation activities of midstream
   enterprises. The results show that the digital transformation of
   enterprises within the supply chain exhibits a transmission effect, and
   the digital transformation of upstream and downstream enterprises
   significantly promotes the innovation performance of midstream
   enterprises. The mechanistic analysis revealed that the digital
   transformation of upstream and downstream enterprises mainly enhances
   the resilience of the supply chain by improving its efficiency,
   optimizing the match between supply and demand, and stabilizing the
   relationship between supply and demand, thus promoting the innovation
   level of midstream enterprises. Further analysis shows that improvements
   in the innovation output of midstream enterprises are reflected in the
   quality of innovation. When the upstream and downstream firms belong to
   the same industry, the supply chain spillover effect of digital
   transformation is more evident, and simultaneously, the digital
   collaboration of the supply chain can promote the innovation of
   midstream enterprises. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

	abstract = {The escalating competition in the digital age has forced firms to
   increase their bargaining power. Given that firms are accelerating
   digital transformation (DT), clarifying the connection between DT and
   firms' bargaining power remains to be determined. Therefore, this
   research, utilizing data from Chinese listed firms, demonstrates a
   positive association between digital transformation and firms'
   bargaining power when dealing with suppliers and customers. After
   addressing endogeneity concerns and conducting alternative robustness
   checks, this result remains robust. Furthermore, mechanism analysis
   reveals that the positive connection is mediated by higher firms'
   innovation capabilities, optimized human capital structures, and lower
   transaction costs. Moreover, this positive nexus is weaker among firms
   located upstream in the supply chain and those with lower
   competitiveness, and stronger when firms face high economic uncertainty.
   Overall, these findings theoretically contribute to Schumpeterian
   innovation and human capital theories and provide managerial suggestions

	abstract = {Background: Digital transformation is an ongoing sosio-technological
   process that can create opportunities in the health sector. However, the
   current landscape of digital transformation in hospital-at-home care is
   unknown. Aim: To describe healthcare providers' perspectives of digital
   transformation in hospital-at-home care. Methods: A total of 25
   semi-structured interviews were conducted in September-October 2023 in
   all Finnish wellbeing services counties (n = 21), the city of Helsinki
   (n = 1), and private health care providers (n = 3). Snowball sampling
   was used (N = 46). The data underwent an inductive content analysis.
   Result: The analysis revealed four main and 17 generic categories of
   challenges and opportunities of digital transformation in
   hospital-at-home care. These challenges and opportunities were related
   to 1) Health information exchange in and across hospital-at-home care;
   2) Management of hospital-at-home care; 3) Logistics in hospital-at-home
   care planning and delivery; and 4) Digital health interventions in
   hospital-at-home care delivery. Conclusions: The challenges and
   opportunities of digital transformation in the hospital-at-home care is
   intricately linked to the efficiency of health information exchange,
   management, logistics, and digital health interventions. Addressing the
   key areas of improvement in health information exchange can lead to more
   streamlined patient care processes and improved communication between
   healthcare professionals and patients. Digital transformation in
   management and logistics can improve overall efficiency within
   healthcare systems. Digital health interventions may promote equitable
   and universal access to high-quality healthcare. Continued focus on
   health care information infrastructure, in particular interoperability
   of electronic health records and optimization of information flow, will
   be essential to realize the full potential of digitalization.},

   technologies on digitization, digitalization, and digital
   transformation. However, it often conflates such terms and ignores the
   pervasive role of datafication. To address these issues, this study
   develops a processual view of digital transformation to explore how
   multiple accounting technologies and widespread digitization,
   digitalization, and datafication practices are implicated in the digital
   transformation of a public sector organization. In doing so, we draw on
   longitudinal, case-study evidence of a healthcare provider in England
   and highlight both the evolutionary and revolutionary ways through which
   organizational change manifested. The study develops a threefold
   contribution to the accounting and public administration literature.
   First, it offers a processual view of digital transformation that is
   conceptually distinct yet interlinked with entangled digitization,
   digitalization, and datafication practices. Second, it indicates that
   revolutionary change manifests in tandem with datafication practices
   which centralize control and empower diverse actors, while also creating
   inter-organizational tensions. Third, it contributes an understanding of
   how potentially contested datafication practices, novel digital
   infrastructures, and hybrid organizational forms gain social approval in

	abstract = {Digital transformation brings new opportunities but also presents
   challenges for firms aiming to enhance organizational resilience. This
   study delves into the paradoxical effects of digital transformation by
   focusing on two critical dimensions of organizational resilience:
   resistance capacity and recovery capacity. By integrating Dynamic
   Capability Theory (DCT) and Resource Dependence Theory (RDT), we explore
   how opportunities for dynamic learning and adaptability, afforded by
   utilizing both internal resources from digital transformation and
   external resources from outside partners, may affect organizational
   resilience in the manufacturing sector. Analyzing a panel dataset of
   15,845 firm-year observations from 2,002 organizations listed on China's
   Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (2011-2021), we uncover a digital
   transformation paradox: it negatively impacts resistance capacity but
   positively influences recovery capacity. Interestingly, customer and
   supplier concentrations mitigate the negative effect of digital
   transformation on resistance capacity, but they do not significantly
   affect the relationship between digital transformation and recovery
   capacity. This study provides valuable insights by integrating
   perspectives from dynamic capability and external resource dependence.
   It offers both theoretical and practical implications for effectively
   managing digital transformation and enhancing organizational resilience

	abstract = {In times of disruption, a company's ability to manage its supply chain
   effectively can determine its success or failure. This paper explores
   the extent to which strategic partnership development, mediated by
   digital transformation, enhances supply chain effectiveness during such
   periods. A mixed methods approach was used, involving surveys and
   interviews with professionals from the Saudi Arabian manufacturing
   sector. The study's findings reveal that digital transformation and
   strategic partnerships work synergistically together to enhance supply
   chain resilience and effectiveness, resulting in improved operational
   agility and adaptability. Four key enablers of supply chain digital
   transformation were identified: inter-business coordination, leadership,
   technological culture, and recruitment management. These insights
   contribute significantly to our understanding of how businesses can
   build resilient supply chains in uncertain environments.},

	abstract = {Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) play a key role in bolstering European
   companies to overwhelm innovation barriers and drive Europe as the
   world's primary leader in the Industry 4.0 digital revolution; they are
   one-stop-shop ecosystems able to provide four main functionalities (test
   before investing, support to find investments, innovation ecosystems,
   and networking, skills and training). Even if a surge in their diffusion
   has been registered, their sustainability is still far from being well
   defined in a structured way. Several approaches and methods are
   available from literature to ground the sustainability plan of
   companies' business. Among them, the first activity to be addressed is
   the value proposition (VP) analysis, and the most diffused approach is
   the Value Proposition Canvas (VPC); this paper proposes the application
   of the VPC (jointly used with other methods from the VP literature) to
   build the VP of the HUBCAP network (supporting European small and
   medium-sized enterprises in the adoption of model-based design methods
   and tools to support cyber-physical system technologies) per each of its
   four main customer segments (DIHs, academic partners and research and
   technology organizations, technology/tool providers and technology/tool
   users). Results highlight the need to characterize the analysis per each
   of these customers, open up new opportunities to build a structured
   business model of the network, and constitute a basis for assessing the
   potential synergies with similar DIH networks. The method proposed can
   be applied to any other DIH or network of DIH to define their specific
   VP, ground the strategy to reach their sustainability, and trigger
   collaborations with each of the four customer segments considered in the
   analysis.},

	abstract = {Background: Patient organizations (POs) are an integral part of the
   health care landscape, serving as advocates and support systems for
   patients and their families. As the digitalization of health care
   accelerates, POs are challenged to adapt their diverse roles to digital
   formats. However, the extent and form of POs' digital adaptation and the
   challenges POs encounter in their digital transformation remain
   unexplored. Objective: This study aims to investigate the digital
   transformation processes within POs. We examined the types of digital
   activities and processes implemented, people involved in respective
   tasks, challenges encountered, and attitudes toward the digitalization
   of POs. Methods: The study was carried out by the multicenter
   interdisciplinary research network Pandora. We adopted a qualitative
   exploratory approach by conducting 37 semistructured interviews and 2
   focus groups with representatives and members of POs in Germany. Results
   were obtained using a deductive-inductive approach based on a
   qualitative content analysis. Methods and results were reported in
   accordance with the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting
   Qualitative Research) checklist. Results: POs primarily apply basic
   digital tools to engage in communication, health education, and
   information dissemination. Some also develop specific mobile apps and
   collect health data through patient registries. Volunteers cover a
   considerable part of the workload. Sometimes, POs collaborate with
   external partners, such as health professionals or other nonprofit
   organizations. Furthermore, many (13/46, 28\%) interviewees referred to
   the importance of involving members in digitalization efforts to better
   meet their needs. However, they described the actual practices used to
   involve members in, for example, developing digital services as limited,
   passive, or implicit. When evaluating digital transformation processes,
   representatives and members of POs expressed generally positive
   attitudes and acknowledged their potentialto improve the accessibility
   of support services, management efficiency, and outreach. Still,
   resource constraints; the complexity of digital initiatives; and
   accessibility issues for certain demographic groups, especially older
   persons, were frequently mentioned as challenges. Several (15/46, 33\%)
   interviewees highlighted POs' increasing responsibility to support their
   members' digital competencies and digital health literacy.
   Conclusions:POs are actively involved in the digital transformation of
   health services. To navigate challenges and further shape and sustain
   digital activities and processes, POs may benefit from governance
   frameworks, that is, a clear plan outlining with whom, how, and with
   what objectives digital projects are being realized. Support from
   public, scientific, and policy institutions to enhance the process
   through training, mentorship, and fostering collaborative networks seems
   warranted.},

	abstract = {In recent years, under the impact of digitization, all industries around
   the world have undergone unprecedented changes. Such changes have not
   only altered people's consumption behavior but have also forced
   enterprises to accelerate the pace of digitization and actively start
   digital transformation. In this study, a literature review and focus
   group interview (FGI) were used to develop the dimensions and criteria
   to assess enterprise digital transformation status. To illustrate the
   digital transformation criteria proposed in this research, the retail
   industry was used as an example to measure the overall digital
   transformation performance by data envelopment analysis (DEA). The
   results show that the poor technical efficiency demonstrated by a vendor
   was not only due to the gradually decreasing returns to scale of the
   market; a decline in pure technical efficiency was also a contributor.
   In addition to adjusting their production on the basis of market
   conditions, vendors should properly manage their internal operations and
   pay attention to their resource and scale allocations to prevent
   reductions in their pure technical efficiency.},

   flexibility, digital transformation, supply chain concentration, and
   productivity in the context of Chinese manufacturing
   enterprises.Design/methodology/approachEmpirical analysis was conducted
   using data from listed Chinese manufacturing firms spanning from 2013 to
   2022. The study employs a moderated model to examine how digital
   transformation influences the connection between inventory flexibility
   and productivity. Additionally, a moderated moderation model is utilized
   to explore the role of supply chain concentration in moderating the
   relationship among inventory flexibility, digital transformation, and
   productivity.FindingsThe study reveals a significant positive
   correlation between inventory flexibility and productivity, underlining
   the importance of flexible inventory management. Digital transformation
   moderates this relationship, with digital transformation enhancing the
   impact of inventory flexibility on productivity. Supplier and customer
   concentration also positively moderate this connection, suggesting a
   complementary relationship with digital transformation.Practical
   implicationsThese findings offer valuable insights for managers and
   policymakers, emphasizing the need for a flexible approach to inventory
   management that considers the evolving digital landscape and supply
   chain dynamics.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature
   by providing empirical evidence of the nuanced relationship between
   inventory flexibility, digital transformation, supply chain
   concentration, and productivity in Chinese manufacturing enterprises. It
   underscores the importance of integrating digital transformation and
   supply chain concentration initiatives with flexible inventory

	abstract = {Enabling greening through digitalization has become an effective way for
   enterprises to achieve green transformation. Previous studies have not
   examined whether the digital transformation of businesses contributes to
   green technology innovation among upstream and downstream enterprises
   from a supply chain perspective. To fill this gap, this study constructs
   a supplier - customer - year supply chain relationship sample using data
   on Chinese listed companies from 2009 to 2020, and applies a two-way
   fixed-effects model to examine the impact of downstream customers'
   digital transformation on upstream suppliers' green technology
   innovation. Findings show that customer-driven digital transformation
   significantly increases suppliers' green technological innovation,
   through the action channels of the forcing effect of green
   transformation, cohort effect of digital transformation, and spillover
   effect of green technological innovation. Heterogeneity analysis reveals
   that the effect of customer digital transformation on suppliers' green
   technological innovation differs significantly based on different
   supplier and customer characteristics. Further analysis indicates that
   the synergy between digitalization and greening created by customer
   digital transformation can also play a crucial role in enhancing
   suppliers' environmental and social governance performance. The findings
   have significant policy implications for the synergistic development of
   digitalization and greening of the entire supply chain, with the
   opportunity to foster sustainable socioeconomic development.},

	abstract = {This research investigates the relationship between DI and CSR from the
   metaorganizational perspective. Metaorganizations represent collectives
   of organizations that function collectively to achieve shared goals and
   objectives. The study underscores the significant influence of DI on CSR
   initiatives, suggesting that firms should strategically align their
   digital innovation endeavors with their CSR objectives. Alignment
   between digital innovation and CSR objectives can cultivate a more
   integrated strategy that delivers both business and societal value.
   Furthermore, our findings reveal that firms operating under conditions
   of higher value appropriation, partner concentration, and environmental
   uncertainty tend to be more proactive in their CSR efforts within the DI
   context. This observation stems from a noticeable shift in primary
   focus: value creation and capture are no longer exclusive goals, but,
   rather, there is an increased emphasis on social benefits. This change
   necessitates a strategic recalibration by firms to incorporate a more
   robust focus on sustainability and social responsibility within their
   business models in the digital era. Our hypotheses are substantiated by
   results obtained from a longitudinal sample of Chinese listed firms. The
   contribution of this study is that it offers novel insight into the

	abstract = {In the current economic environment, the digital transformation of
   businesses plays a pivotal role in supply chain management. This study,
   based on data from Chinese listed companies between 2012 and 2021,
   empirically tests the significant enhancement of total factor
   productivity in en- terprises due to digital transformation by matching
   data at the enterprise level of upstream suppliers and downstream

   exerts its influence by optimizing supply-demand matching and reducing
   transaction costs. The impact of digital transformation exhibits
   heterogeneity in the characteristics of vertical relationship
   structures, including differences in enterprise scale, ownership nature,
   and innovation level. Such changes drive the overall efficiency
   improvement of the corporate supply chain, leading to higher pro-

	abstract = {Purpose The risks associated with digital innovation increasingly
   challenge value co-creation among stakeholders within the innovation
   ecosystem. Stakeholder collaboration is helpful in preventing risk
   occurrence. This study intends to explore the effects of different
   stakeholder collaboration strategies on risk prevention performance in a
   digital innovation ecosystem context. Design/methodology/approach A
   systematic literature analysis was first conducted to identify risk
   factors of digital innovation based on the
   technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework. Then, a
   bidimensional network model was constructed to visualize the
   collaborative relationships among stakeholders and the identified risks
   by focusing on a digital innovation case. The social network analysis
   method was applied to design stakeholder collaboration strategies from
   the ego and global network perspectives, and a simulation approach was
   conducted to evaluate the effects of the strategies on risk prevention
   performance. Findings The results validate the positive effect of
   stakeholder collaboration on risk prevention performance and reveal the
   important role of network reachability in formulating collaboration
   strategies. The strategy of strong-strong collaboration strategy can
   best enhance risk prevention performance like a ``Matthew effect{''} in
   the digital innovation ecosystem. Originality/value First, risk
   identification based on the TOE framework provides a systematic list of
   risk factors for future digital innovation risk management research.
   Second, this study designs stakeholder collaboration strategies from a
   network perspective to enhance the understanding of the network status
   of each stakeholder and the network structure of the digital innovation
   ecosystem. Third, the simulation results reveal the effects of different
   collaboration strategies on risk prevention performance.},

   game player and the stability of the system equilibrium point. Moreover,
   the validity of the model and the influence of various factors on the
   system were verified and analyzed by numerical simulation. The results
   showed the following: (1) The government's tax refund ratio and subsidy
   coefficient can significantly increase the motivation of construction
   enterprises and digital construction service providers within a certain
   threshold. (2) Whether enterprises carry out a comprehensive digital
   transformation depends on the revenue of the system solution strategy;
   the greater the revenue, the more positive the enterprises. (3) The
   adoption of high rewards and high penalties by the superior government
   can effectively encourage the local government to actively promote

	abstract = {In the digital era, cloud computing stands as a pivotal tool in the
   transformative journey of enterprises, with China's tech landscape
   serving as a prime exemplar. However, when enterprises embrace cloud
   computing, they face complex hurdles, mainly technical ones. To
   understand how the complexity of cloud migration affects their digital
   transformation, our research meticulously constructed business process
   models for business deployment in both non-cloud and cloud contexts,
   spanning the IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS levels. By harnessing China's public
   cloud market data, we constructed the Cloud Migration Complexity Index,
   providing a tangible metric to gauge the intricacies of cloud migration
   and their implications on digital transformation. The findings
   illustrate that a decrease in cloud migration complexity significantly
   accelerates digital transformation, with the reduction in SaaS
   complexity having the most profound impact. Analyzing businesses of
   varying scales, the diminishing complexity of SaaS predominantly boosts
   digital transformation for non-SME enterprises, while reduced PaaS

	abstract = {Innovation Management Software can promote Entrepreneurial Ecosystems by
   consolidating an organization's innovation programs, stakeholders, and
   resources in one place. In this study, we highlighted the digitalization
   of innovation processes. We focus particularly on the factors
   influencing the adoption of a specific class of software tools called
   Innovation Management Software (IMS) or Digital Innovation Management
   System to support innovation management methods and activities.
   Specifically, we address the two questions (a) which specific
   functionality drives the adoption of IMS tools, and (b) which services
   of IMS providers are valuable in supporting the adoption of IMS by
   organizations aiming to digitalize their innovation processes. By using
   an online questionnaire, we gathered survey data from 199 innovation
   managers of German firms. We used regression analysis to test our
   hypotheses. While the overall IMS adoption is considered to positively
   affect the new product development (NPD) efficiency, our results
   indicate that especially idea management functionalities and services
   for updates and upgrades improve the IMS adoption. Surprisingly,
   offering complementary consulting services together with IMS offerings
   to support the digitalization of innovation processes reduces the
   likelihood of IMS adoption. These findings are important for managers,
   consultants, and developers in order to choose and leverage the right
   options for improving the adoption of IT tools in the NPD process and
   therefore increase NPD performance and thus also promote Entrepreneurial
   Ecosystems.},

   research has examined the impact of supply chain diversification and
   digital transformation on supply chain resilience, but few studies have
   integrated these two aspects to understand their impact on supply chain
   resilience. Given this, our study implements the fuzzy set qualitative
   comparative analysis (fsQCA) method to investigate the influence of
   supply chain diversification (supply base diversification and customer
   base diversification) and digital transformation (digital transformation
   depth and breadth) on supply chain resilience. Using data from 191
   listed manufacturing firms, it is shown that the dimensions of supply
   chain diversification and digital transformation do not have the
   necessary conditions to achieve high supply chain resilience, while the
   analysis of sufficient conditions shows that three paths can achieve
   high supply chain resilience-namely, those driven by digital
   transformation, supply chain diversification, and supplier
   centralization and customer base diversification. This study
   demonstrates the numerous and complex linkages between antecedent and
   outcome, and firms can choose the path that is best for them to improve
   supply chain resilience based on their size, degree of digital

	abstract = {Nowadays, no organization or sector is immune to the influences of
   digital transformation. It has been generally recognized as a
   significant promoter of corporate efficiency and effectiveness. However,
   the literature on whether and how digital transformation can facilitate
   corporate total factor productivity is scarce. In this case, this paper
   aims to empirically investigate whether and how digital transformation
   can boost a firm's total factor productivity. Using a sample of Chinese
   listed companies from 2007-2020 and structural equation model analyses
   in STATA 16.0, this paper identifies that (1) digital technology, one
   dimension of digital transformation, has no significant effects on
   enterprise total factor productivity, while digital application, the
   other dimension of digital transformation, can directly enhance
   enterprise total factor productivity; (2) both digital technology and
   digital application can indirectly boost enterprise total factor
   productivity through the decreasing of supplier concentration; and (3)
   digital technology adversely affects enterprise total factor
   productivity through the increasing of customer concentration, and
   digital application may positively affect enterprise total factor
   productivity through the decreasing of customer concentration. Our study
   is one of the first to explore the mediating effect mechanism of the
   relationship between digital transformation and enterprise total factor
   productivity from the perspective of supply chain management.},

	abstract = {Digitalization has provoked rapid changes in the operational landscape,
   thus requiring prompt decision-making across end-to-end supply chains.
   Notwithstanding the fact that technology is the epicenter of digital
   transformation, more often than not, organizations fail to effectively
   adopt innovative applications, harness their full potential, and realize
   growth and competitiveness. Therefore, this article argues that a unique
   strategy formulation process is required to embrace digitalization in
   manufacturing supply chains. However, within the context of
   manufacturing networks, strategy formulation approaches are limited. To
   this end, this article adopts a case study approach to extract tacit
   knowledge across 12 multinational companies within the theoretical
   boundaries of corporate strategy development. Research findings and a
   theoretically derived framework demonstrate that there are three
   typologies of digital strategy development for manufacturing supply
   chains, namely: 1) top-down; 2) bottom-up; and 3) mixed. Every
   identified typology is supplemented with three determinant criteria for
   digital supply chain strategy formulation, i.e., number of suppliers,
   market demand, and product types. Noteworthy, the aforementioned
   strategies are context-dependent. This article contributes to the
   operations management field by formulating a novel strategy development
   framework for digital supply chains. The proposed framework, synthesized
   via strategic management theoretical views and primary evidence, can
   provide a reference point as companies chart their current and future
   digital supply chain strategy state.},

	abstract = {Although health care delivery is becoming increasingly digitized, driven
   by the pursuit of improved access, equity, efficiency, and
   effectiveness, progress does not appear to be equally distributed across
   therapeutic areas. Oncology is renowned for leading innovation in
   research and in care; digital pathology, digital radiology, real-world
   data, next-generation sequencing, patient-reported outcomes, and
   precision approaches driven by complex data and biomarkers are hallmarks
   of the field. However, remote patient monitoring, decentralized
   approaches to care and research, ``hospital at home,{''} and machine
   learning techniques have yet to be broadly deployed to improve cancer
   care. In response, the Digital Medicine Society and Moffitt Cancer
   Center convened a multistakeholder roundtable discussion to bring
   together leading experts in cancer care and digital innovation. This
   viewpoint highlights the findings from these discussions, in which
   experts agreed that digital innovation is lagging in oncology relative
   to other therapeutic areas. It reports that this lag is most likely
   attributed to poor articulation of the challenges in cancer care and
   research best suited to digital solutions, lack of incentives and
   support, and missing standardized infrastructure to implement digital
   innovations. It concludes with suggestions for actions needed to bring
   the promise of digitization to cancer care to improve lives.},

	abstract = {Purpose To better understand the role of industrial big data in
   promoting digital transformation, the authors propose a theoretical
   framework of industrial big-data-based affordance in the form of an
   illustrative metaphor - what the authors call the ``organizational
   drivetrain.{''} Design/methodology/approach This study investigates the
   effective use of industrial big data in the process of digital
   transformation based on the technology affordance-actualization
   theoretical lens. A software platform and services provider with more
   than 4,000 industrial enterprise clients in China was selected as the
   case study object for analyzing the digital affordance and actualization
   driven by industrial big data. Findings Drawing on a revelatory case
   study, the authors identify three affordances of industrial big data in
   the organization, namely developing data-driven customized projects,
   provisioning equipment-data-driven life cycle services, establishing
   data-based trust and determining affordance actualization actions driven
   by technology and market. In addition, the authors reveal the underlying
   drivetrain mechanisms to advance industrial big data affordance and
   actualization: stabilizing, enriching and pioneering. Originality/value
   This study builds a drivetrain model on digital transformation by
   industrial big data affordance actualization. The authors also provide
   practical implications that can help practitioners to implement digital
   transformation effectively and extract value from their investment.},

	abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to explore the relationship between digital
   transformation, international competition and productivity progress by
   examining the dual margins of export, thereby identifying the digital
   development pathway for key industrial chains within the context of
   regional medical and health cooperation.Design/methodology/approachBy
   constructing models incorporating both the extensive margin and
   intensive margin, this paper delves into the reasons underlying changes
   in product trade value and variety within international market
   competition. Utilizing export data for medical products from China to
   Belt and Road Initiative partner countries spanning from 2007 to 2020,
   an industry-destination-time panel benchmark model is established to
   assess the impact of digital transformation on product expansion and
   international competition.FindingsThe findings reveal the following
   insights. First, digital transformation positively impacts the intensive
   margin of medical products, whereas it does not exert a positive
   influence on the extensive margin. Second, the impact mechanism test
   indicates that digital transformation fosters the intensive export
   margin by enhancing the technical efficiency of exports but exhibits an
   inverted U-shaped effect on technological progress. Third, digital
   transformation demonstrates a notable non-linear characteristic, with a
   substantial increase in the lifting effect once a certain threshold is
   surpassed.Originality/valueWhile previous research has extensively
   explored the effects of digital transformation on export trade, this
   study uniquely integrates the concepts of the intensive and extensive
   margins of export, thereby enriching the research insights derived from
   existing literature. It focuses on the nonlinear effects and threshold
   dynamics of digital transformation, particularly in relation to total
   factor productivity. Additionally, the paper makes a contribution to the
   understanding of the Health Silk Road by incorporating the health index.},

	abstract = {Schools, universities, and other educational entities are increasingly
   aware of the untapped potential of digital transformation, an essential
   process for increasing efficiency and collaboration, and reducing costs
   and errors in the management of at-scale training systems. In this
   context, the ``Riconnessioni'' project was promoted by the Compagnia di
   San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned,
   started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital
   transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged
   opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives
   of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was
   developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow's
   digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build
   an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful,
   secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the
   three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of
   teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and
   experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of
   opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and
   systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been
   included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up
   the instructional process. Using a methodology called ``cascade
   training'', the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge
   to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity
   performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on
   implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly
   evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it
   verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements.
   Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers' and
   students' skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment
   framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding
   feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation
   highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers' competence
   and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital
   domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.},

	abstract = {Local governments are in an ideal position to integrate government,
   private, and citizen data to deliver beneficial new digitally enabled
   public services. However, progress toward achieving the benefits has
   stagnated in many cases. This is because managers lack the requisite
   know-how to lead the implementation and enactment of integrated
   enterprise systems to improve the processes of public service delivery,
   part of a journey called `digital transformation'. If digital
   transformations are to progress, we need more nuanced empirical
   elaboration of the know-how managers require. To that end, this study
   reports evidence from case studies in 11 local governments in Canada.
   The findings provide the empirical basis for a theory of the know-how
   managers require to lead the implementation and enactment of integrated
   enterprise systems in support of digital transformation. We then propose
   a new theoretical model of how to transfer that requisite know-how to
   managers through public-private partnerships, and thereby mitigate

   knowledge-based theories, digital technologies boost efficiency and
   flexibility, reduce transaction costs, and enable the leveraging of a
   diverse resource pool, which ultimately leads to improved performance
   among supply chain participants. The results indicate a positive

	abstract = {The advent and proliferation of digital technologies purport to increase
   the innovation potential of most organizations. However, approximately
   90\% of new ideas never convert to new product or service deliveries
   because of the lack of organizational readiness. This paper
   conceptualizes a formative multidimensional construct to gauge
   organizational readiness for digital innovations. Such a construct would
   facilitate cumulative research on the role of digital innovation, while
   benchmarking to track organizational readiness. The proposed construct
   includes 21 measures, categorized under seven subconstructs: resource
   readiness, IT readiness, cognitive readiness, partnership readiness,

	abstract = {By employing four game models, this paper examines the impact of both
   monetary and symbolic incentives on supplier participation in digital
   transformation of a two-echelon supply chain. We find that in the
   presence of monetary incentives, the supplier may exhibit free riding
   behavior when the buyer's cost-sharing is sufficiently high, thereby
   leaving the buyer with no incentive to motivate the supplier. In
   contrast, a hybrid contract combining monetary with symbolic in-centives
   enhances supplier participation. As the hybrid incentive is not always
   effective, we propose an improved hybrid contract with a
   reward-punishment mechanism to better motivate the supplier. Analytical
   results reveal that both members enjoy higher profitability when the
   buyer's reward and punishment scheme is set within a reasonable range.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The objective of the study is to evaluate telehealth
   vis-a-vis traditional care from healthcare providers, and patients'
   perspectives through the task-technology-fit lens. It attempts to create
   a descriptive, prescriptive, and comparative framework. Methods: Using
   the input of two separate focus groups, this study compares telehealth
   with traditional care through the lenses of the Task-Technology-Fit
   theory. For the second objective, the study first reviews the existing
   literature to find out the research gap and establish the need for the
   model. The study uses the case study method to evaluate eight telehealth
   providers using the proposed model. The study then uses
   Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) to create a perceptual map for these
   telehealth providers.Results: The proposed Digital Transformation
   Evaluation Model (DTEM) uses three dimensions convergence, maturity, and
   adoption to evaluate telehealth providers. The performance of the case
   organization on three dimensions was decided based on secondary data
   available in the public domain and input from administrators at these
   case organizations. The findings of the study suggest that DTEM is an
   effective tool to analyze telehealth providers and identify improvement
   areas.Conclusions: The study concludes that there is a lack of
   standardization in the telehealth field. The study also suggests that
   patients are more aggressive in the adoption of telehealth in comparison
   to healthcare providers. To understand the transition of case
   organization into telehealth the study performs a dynamic capability
   analysis. The proposed model in this study is useful for healthcare
   administrators and policymakers. The study contributes to theory
   development in telehealth.Public Interest Summary: Using the input of
   two separate focus groups, this study compares telehealth with
   traditional care through the lenses of the Task Technology-Fit theory.

	abstract = {Nowadays, various industries are increasingly investing in constructing
   big data platforms to achieve digitalisation. Digitalisation has become
   a critical factor in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
   enterprises. This paper explores the influence of digital transformation
   (DIT) on corporate total factor productivity (TFP). Based on data from
   publicly listed enterprises in China from 2007 to 2022, this paper
   demonstrates that DIT significantly improves their TFP. Supplier
   concentration partially mediates the relationship between DIT and TFP.
   Furthermore, the enterprise life cycle moderates the impact of DIT on
   TFP. Specifically, during the growth stage, the influence of DIT on TFP
   is not significant. During the maturity and decline stages, DIT
   positively affects the TFP. The impact of DIT on TFP is particularly
   pronounced in enterprises in western China, as well as in large and
   high-tech enterprises. The paper examines whether, how and when DIT
   affect TFP. The findings contribute novel evidence that strategic DIT
   enable enterprise to improve TFP through decreased supplier
   concentration. For both scholars and practitioners, this research
   provides valuable insights into how digital transformation can pay
   dividends by improving overall productivity.},

	abstract = {This study examines how customer firms' digital transformation affects
   the performance and value creation of their suppliers in the Chinese
   context. We use text mining to construct digital transformation
   indicators for customer firms based on data from Chinese A -share
   -listed firms from 2011 to 2021. We find that customer firms' digital
   transformation has a positive and significant impact on supplier
   performance, and this effect is robust to various sensitivity tests. We
   also find that customer firms' digital transformation influences
   supplier performance through two mechanisms: demand push and innovation
   spillover. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that the effect
   of customer firms' digital transformation on supplier performance varies
   by different factors, such as geographic distance, customer
   concentration, ownership type, and industry type. This study contributes
   to the literature on supply chain value from a customer -driven
   perspective and provides practical implications for supply chain firms

	abstract = {In many business domains, rapid changes have occurred as a consequence
   of digital innovation, i.e., the application of novel information
   technologies to achieve specific business goals. A domain where digital
   innovation has great potential is smart mobility, which aims at moving
   around large sets of people and goods in a specific geographic setting
   in an efficient and effective way. So far, many innovations in this
   domain have concentrated on relatively isolated, technology-driven
   developments, such as smart route planning for individual travelers.
   Nice as they are, they have relatively small impact on mobility on a
   large scale. To achieve substantial digital innovations - for example,
   optimizing commuting on a city-scale - it is necessary to align the
   efforts and related values of a spectrum of stakeholders that need to
   collaborate in a common business model. To this aim, the study proposes
   the use of service-dominant business logic, which emphasizes the
   interaction of value network partners as they co-create value through
   collaborative processes. Moving to this paradigm has significant
   implications on the way business is done: the business requirements for
   services will change faster, and the complexity of value networks
   required to meet these requirements will increase further. This requires
   new approaches to business engineering that are grounded in the premises
   of service-dominant logic. The paper introduces the service-dominant
   business model radar (SDBM/R) as an integral component of a business
   engineering framework. Following a design science approach, the SDBM/R
   has been developed in close collaboration with industry experts and
   evaluated through an extensive series of hands-on workshops with
   industry professionals from several business domains. This paper focuses
   on the application and evaluation in the smart mobility domain,
   addressing the design of new business models for digital innovation of
   collaborative transport of people and goods. In summary, it contributes
   a novel business design approach that has an academic background and
   relevant practical embedding.},

	abstract = {The rapid digitalization of organizations has positioned the digital
   transformation of Human Resources (HR) as a critical trend for the
   future. In particular, exponential organizations-characterized by their
   ability to leverage digital technology to achieve disproportionately
   large impacts relative to their size-require a fundamental shift in the
   role and competencies of HR professionals. This study focuses on the
   competencies required of Human Resource Directors (HRDs) within these
   highly adaptive and scalable organizations, using Shandong Province as a
   case sample. Grounded in the Resource-Based View (RBV), which emphasizes
   that a firm's internal resources are essential for sustaining
   competitive advantage, we argue that HRDs competencies are critical
   resources for organizations undergoing digital transformation. Through
   the application of methods such as questionnaire surveys, structural
   equation modeling, and t-tests, we identified and validated 11 key
   competency indicators for HRDs in the context of digital transformation.
   These indicators are grouped into four dimensions based on Dave Ulrich's
   framework: Strategic Partner, Change Agent, Administrative Expert, and
   Employee Champion. Our research organizes these 11 competencies within
   the four dimensions, providing a structured framework for evaluating the
   evolving role of HRDs in the digital era. These 11 competencies offer
   organizations valuable insights, particularly in organizational
   development, talent acquisition and deployment, employee training and
   upskilling, and performance evaluation, contributing to a more
   comprehensive understanding of the competencies needed for HR leadership
   in the digital age.},

	abstract = {As a representative of clean energy enterprises, the digital
   transformation of new energy enterprises is crucial to achieving green
   development. Digital transformation has a green economic effect,
   enabling green finance to provide intrinsic incentives and strategic
   resources for the digital transformation of new energy enterprises.
   Based on a quasi-natural experiment in the Green Finance Reform and
   Innovation Pilot Zone, this paper analyses the impact of green finance
   innovation on the digital transformation of new energy enterprises and
   the mechanism effect of supply chain discourse and dynamic capabilities
   using data from Chinese A-share new energy enterprises from 2008 to 2022
   using a double difference model. It is found that green financial
   innovation can significantly promote the digital transformation of new
   energy enterprises, and the promotion effect has strong stability and
   continuity. The impact of green financial innovation on digital
   transformation is heterogeneous across different types of new energy
   enterprises. This driving effect is more obvious in new energy
   enterprises with lower labour factor input levels, ESG levels and audit
   quality, and smaller enterprise scale. From the perspective of supply
   chain voice, green financial innovation can effectively promote the
   digital transformation of new energy enterprises by facilitating their
   voice to suppliers and customers. From the perspective of dynamic
   capabilities, green financial innovation can promote the digital
   transformation of new energy enterprises by promoting the dynamic
   capabilities of enterprises such as absorptive capacity, innovative
   capacity and adaptive capacity. This study provides theoretical support
   and policy insights for improving the green financial innovation system
   and guiding the digital transformation of new energy enterprises.},

	abstract = {Representing a new mode of collaboration in the digital economy,
   collaborative problemistic search capability (CPS) refers to a firm's
   digital collaboration with its customers or suppliers to filter and
   interpret market-facing information in its search for new products or
   services (Karhade \& Dong, 2021). Drawing on the organizational search
   theory, this study unpacks CPS into CPS with customers (CPS-C) and CPS
   with suppliers (CPS-S) and examines the effects of CPS-C and CPS-S on
   digital innovation and their interactions with IT capability and legal
   development in the context of China. Specifically, we argue that both
   CPS-C and CPS-S exert a positive effect on digital innovation, and IT
   capability demonstrates a complementary effect by enhancing the effect
   of CPS-C and a substitutive effect by reducing the effect of CPS-S,
   whereas legal development magnifies both the complementary effect and
   the substitutive effect of IT capability. A survey among multiple
   managers of a sample of firms in China supports the hypotheses. The
   research results make important contributions that advance existing

	abstract = {Research background: SMEs' concern for the digital literacy of their
   workforce, their interest in increasing digital literacy among
   employees, and securing their digital platforms, have been major issues
   in their digital transformation process. To reduce those obstacles, the
   dynamic capabilities of SMEs included in the Resource-based View (RBV)
   might be an effective solution since they help companies be more
   competitive and proactive against the threats they face in the
   digitalization process.Purpose of the article: This research aims to
   investigate whether SMEs' dynamic capabilities positively contribute to
   their digital transformation process.Methods: In line with the proposed
   relationships, this paper analyzes SMEs from Czechia by running Ordinal
   Logistic Regression analyses. The research sample is created by
   stratified random sampling and purposive sampling methods. The research
   data is collected via tele-phone surveys.Findings \& value added: This
   research does not find a positive relationship between the dynamic
   capabilities of SMEs and the digital transformation process. While the
   results related to digital literacy are negatively associated with
   digital transformation, no significant relation-ship exists between
   security actions and the digital transformation of SMEs. This paper
   ex-tends the scope of RBV on the digital transformation of SMEs by
   analyzing various dynamic capabilities of SMEs that have not been
   included in a sole study. Moreover, the perceptions of SME executives
   are considered by this research to provide effective solutions for the
   problems they face in digital transformation. Having a joint venture
   agreement with well-experienced IT companies, having a network with
   partner firms, looking for funding opportunities in the EU,
   participating in some practical training, and providing internships for
   bachelor students might enable SMEs to hit their targets in digital
   transformation.},

@article{WOS:001319718200001,
	abstract = {CONTEXT: The digital transformation of agriculture is a complex and
   dynamic process involving numerous stakeholders. Inadequate
   participation and collaboration from stakeholders are major factors
   contributing to the difficulties in agricultural digital transformation.
   However, there is a paucity of research that dynamically uncovers the
   driving forces and obstacles of agricultural digitization from the
   perspective of stakeholders. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is
   to systematically analyze the drivers and obstacles faced by government
   incentives, digital technology service providers, and agricultural
   operators in participating in the digital transformation of agriculture.
   METHOD: This article employs evolutionary game theory to construct a
   model of the game between digital technology service providers and
   agricultural operators under the exogenous influence of the government.
   It also conducts stable strategy analysis and numerical simulation to
   explain and predict the behaviors and interaction mechanisms among
   multiple stakeholders in the digital transformation of agriculture.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis reveals four potential equilibrium
   points under specific conditions, identifying that the increase in
   returns and the opportunity costs of not participating in agricultural
   digital transformation are key driving factors. Critical barriers
   include the high costs faced by digital technology service providers and
   agricultural operators, as well as the associated risks of
   non-participation. Government incentives emerge as a crucial exogenous
   factor in promoting agricultural digital transformation. To better
   facilitate this process, we propose policy recommendations and
   management insights. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a new research
   perspective and methodology for agricultural digital transformation,
   offering a more comprehensive reflection of the complexity and
   multidimensionality of the driving and barrier factors influencing this
   process. It also provides theoretical support for explaining phenomena
   such as irrational behavior, multiple equilibria, and path dependence
   that exist in agricultural digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Advancements in digital technology necessitate a shift from traditional
   linear buyer-supplier value chains to a network-centric approach
   facilitated by digital platforms. Despite digital platforms being a
   dominant model for transformation, limited research has explored the
   enablers for incumbent pipeline firms to embrace platformization. To
   address this gap, this study reviews existing literature on digital
   transformation, identifying nine enablers for digital platformization:
   changing client behavior, information technology (IT) capabilities
   development, structural efficiencies, disruptive competitive forces,
   scope advantages, economic triggers, disruptive third-party technology,
   creation of autonomous corporate structures, and regulatory compliance.
   Case studies of platformization in diverse industries are analyzed using
   the modified total interpretive structural modeling (m-TISM) approach,
   resulting in a hierarchical model with five levels. This model
   delineates interrelationships among trigger events, external enablers,
   internal organizational enablers, process enablers, and outcome drivers.
   Furthermore, the study highlights that the creation and extraction of
   value from digital platforms are operationalized through e-business
   strategies, contributing insights to e-business literature by discussing
   the implications of these enablers on dimensions such as commerce,
   collaboration, communication, connection, and computing.},

   corporate digital transformation on supply chain relationship
   transactions from the perspectives of information asymmetry and agency

   inhibits the supply chain relational transactions; the mechanism testing
   results reveal that digital transformation is conducive to the
   alleviation of information asymmetry and agency costs, which thereby
   reduces the degree of supply chain relational transactions; the
   regulatory effect analysis demonstrates that the impact of digital
   transformation on supply chain relationship transactions becomes more
   significant in non-high-tech enterprises and enterprises with less
   fierce industry competition. Finally, this paper confirms that a decline

   resources and the hospitality sector is responsible for a considerable
   portion of this waste. This study analyses the effects, both
   individually and in combination, of hotel digital capability and
   innovation ecosystem coopetition on digital innovation and food waste
   reduction. The data were collected from 200 Brazilian hotels via a
   questionnaire and analysed by PLS-SEM. The results indicate that,
   individually, both hotel digital capability and innovation ecosystem
   coopetition positively affect digital innovation. Furthermore, when
   combined, they promote an additional effect on digital innovation. Our
   results also reveal that digital innovation has a negative effect on
   food waste reduction. We contribute to the Dynamic Capabilities Theory
   by empirically demonstrating that complementarity between internal and
   external capabilities produces synergy and helps in the co-creation of
   value. To be used effectively, knowledge needs to be integrated and
   shared; this is especially the case for complex innovations, such as
   digital innovation, that require high levels of skill. Therefore,
   managers must be aware of the different internal knowledge needs and,

	abstract = {In the process of constructing green supply chains, how to incentivize
   suppliers to participate in green innovation is the main challenge. This
   paper investigates whether digital transformation of customers (CDT) can
   enhance green innovation of suppliers (SGIT) based on the theoretical
   framework of resource dependence theory and digital empowerment theory.
   Paired data of Chinese A-share listed companies and their major
   customers from 2010 to 2020 are used in this study. The conclusions show
   that: (1) CDT can significantly enhance SGIT. For economic significance,
   CDT contributes to an 18 \% increase in green patent applications of
   suppliers. The conclusion remains robust after a series of tests. (2)
   The main influence mechanisms include: a) increasing the demand for
   green innovation (DE), and b) facilitating the spillover of digital
   technologies (SP). (3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that: CDT can more
   significantly drive SGIT in samples with higher customer concentration.
   (4) The effect of CDT on SGIT is more significant for suppliers with
   lower uncertainty and less environmental pollution. (5) The impact of
   CDT on SGIT is more significant in samples where customers and suppliers
   are geographically closer. The findings enhance the understanding of

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how digital
   transformation changes highly traditional business processes and how it
   impacts value co-creation and co-destruction. More specifically, the aim
   is to examine, using the resource interaction approach, how the friction
   between non-digital and digital resources affects the co-creation and
   co-destruction of value in a network during digital transformation.
   Based on this, the authors provide managerial implications on how to
   handle simultaneous digital and traditional business processes to
   co-create value during digital transformation.
   Design/methodology/approach A case study is conducted of a digital
   platform provider and of three traditional confectioneries. In this
   analysis, the authors looked at the business processes of highly
   traditional confectioneries that have introduced online services through
   a digital platform and are undergoing digital transformation. Findings
   In some industries, it is neither possible nor advisable to fully
   digitalise all business processes, and companies have to partially
   retain their traditional, analogue character to create value. The
   process of value co-creation during digital transformation is affected
   by friction between the digital and non-digital resources and is
   mitigated by specific lubricants (e.g. mutual reliance, smooth personal
   communication, willingness to help, attitude towards change). This
   results in the improvement of processes and capabilities in terms of
   digital development and traditional production. Friction may also lead
   to value co-destruction, for example, as the result of transformation
   from face-to-face to digital interactions. Originality/value The authors
   contribute to research on the digital transformation of highly
   traditional companies that need to introduce new, digital technologies
   and resources while continuing their traditional processes. The authors
   develop the concept of lubricants that mitigate the friction between
   resources and, therefore, facilitate value co-creation in a business
   network. Additionally, the authors provide managerial implications for
   how to handle simultaneous digital and traditional business processes
   during digital transformation.},

	abstract = {With respect to the carbon reduction effects of digital transformation
   (DT), the literature focuses mainly on individual firms' performance,
   ignoring the environmental spillovers arising from supplier-buyer
   interactions from a supply chain perspective. By examining the positive

   validate the existence of buyers' DT environmental spillovers. This
   study collects and analyzes supply chain data of Chinese A-share listed
   firms during 2008-2021. We construct an ordinary least squares (OLS)
   model and perform a cluster-robust estimation with supplier-buyer pairs
   as clusters. Mechanism analysis identifies two environmental spillover
   mechanisms-the pushback and technology spillover effects. Moreover, we
   find a spatial decay pattern in the buyers' DT environmental spillovers.
   Heterogeneity analysis indicates that such spillovers are more
   pronounced when suppliers are identified as polluters or when the
   digitization gap is narrower. This study complements the green supply

   collaborative promotion of enterprise digital transformation and
   low-carbon supply chains, has emerged as a critical pathway for
   achieving green and high-quality development in enterprises. In this
   paper, we utilize a mathematical model framework to empirically
   investigate the mechanisms and impacts of enterprise digital
   transformation on the low-carbon effect of supply chains, employing data
   from A-share-listed companies spanning 2011 to 2021. The findings
   indicate that (1) enhancing the degree of enterprise digital
   transformation can significantly decrease the carbon emission intensity
   of upstream suppliers, thereby promoting low-carbon supply chains. (2)
   ``Innovation-driven{''} and ``structural transformation{''} mechanisms
   are vital channels by which enterprise digital transformation promotes
   carbon reduction in supply chains. (3) The diffusion mechanism effect
   and demonstration effect exhibit heterogeneity in the process of
   enterprise digital transformation, driving low-carbon emission

	abstract = {Purpose This study aimed to examine the digital transformation of
   business-to-business (B2B) sales and its effects on the management of
   value-based selling. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a
   qualitative interview research design. A total of two participant
   groups-one consisting of sales management professionals and the other
   consisting of buyers-were created to conduct abductive data analysis to
   gain a new understanding of B2B sales management. Findings As a result
   of the digital transformation of sales, companies are shifting B2B sales
   towards value-based selling using a more proactive, continuous process
   wherein digital value co-creation activities play a big role. Similarly,
   their buyers now expect more proactive communication about new value
   propositions, but social media channels are of little importance to most
   B2B buyers. The management of digital value co-creation activities
   should be addressed from the sales ecosystem perspective, where
   non-sellers tend to have a strong role in communicating new value
   propositions. Research limitations/implications There needs to be
   further research on digital value co-creation activities in the sales
   ecosystem, as value-based selling requires that selling organizations
   focus more on educational digital content marketing and engagement with
   non-sellers via both marketing and sales activities. Practical
   implications Companies rarely exploit experts and project personnel when
   implementing digital sales strategies; however, they often meet with
   customers personally and network with them. This requires a broader
   perspective on sales management. Originality/value This is one of the
   first studies to explore the management of value-based selling from both
   seller and buyer perspectives.},

	abstract = {With the digital technologies diffusion, low-medium technology firms
   have been pushed to advance their dynamic capabilities. Through an
   exploratory multiple-case study, we analyze four Thai family firms
   assessing their preparedness in pursuing a digital transformation
   journey and their ability to improve dynamic capabilities. The study
   shows that LMT firms are in the early stage of their digital
   transformation, which is led by being part of a global value chain,
   serving exigent consumers, and imitating startups. Thai firms revitalize
   business models, while optimizing operations. They build dynamic
   capabilities through the help of third-party providers prioritizing
   social media marketing and digital marketing, with a general awareness
   of environmental, societal, and governance trends. Overall, family firms
   are still reluctant to pursue strategic agility and rapid prototyping.
   Thus, in the absence of an innovation ecosystem supporting family firms,
   it is harder to augment their absorptive capacity and redesign the
   internal structure of the organization.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the globe has faced a series of topics of growing
   concern, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the international financial
   crisis, rising socio-economic inequalities, the negative outcomes of
   greenhouse gas emissions, which resulted in climate change, and many
   others. Organizations worldwide have confronted these new challenges of
   sustainable finance by incorporating environmental, social, and
   corporate governance (ESG) factors and digital transformation (DT) in
   their innovation business strategies. The healthcare sector represents a
   large share of the global economy (about 10\% of global economic
   output), employs a large number of workers, and needs to rely more on an
   open innovation model where interested parties, especially patients, are
   going to have a say in their own well-being. Thus, it is imperative that
   healthcare providers be efficient, effective, resilient, and sustainable
   in the face of significant challenges and risks. At the same time, they
   must offer sustainable development goals and digital transformation to
   healthcare users through limited governmental resources. This study
   investigates the role, importance, and correlation of ESG factors and
   digital transformation to the sustainable finance of healthcare systems
   through an innovative model. The main purpose of the paper is to present
   the already implemented ESG and DT factors in the healthcare sector and
   to propose a mutual and combined implementation strategy based on common
   evaluation tools, methods, and actions. A set of proposed actions and
   strategies are presented for the sustainability and resilience of the

	abstract = {Since the beginning of the 21st century, environmental protection and
   digital supply chains have increasingly garnered attention. As firms
   transition to green practices, how to achieve competitive advantage by
   reducing environmental costs has become one of the key concerns for many
   business managers. This study aims to examine how supplier and customer
   integration affect a firm's environmental cost performance while
   considering the moderating effect of digital transformation. Following a
   survey conducted by a professional research agency on 800 Chinese
   manufacturing firms specializing in green products, the research model
   was tested using structural equation modeling and hierarchical
   regression analysis. The results indicate a significant positive
   relationship between both supplier integration and customer integration
   with a firm's environmental cost performance. Additionally, positive
   digital transformation reinforces the relationship between supplier
   integration and customer integration. However, there are limitations due
   to the study's background, scope, and sample size. This study
   underscores the impact of supplier integration and customer integration
   on a firm's environmental cost performance, as well as the crucial
   moderating role of digital transformation. It contributes to the growing

	abstract = {This article aims to shed light on digital transformation in the
   accounting sector from the perspective of institutional change. We
   performed a systematic literature review to understand how institutional
   change could be applied to research on Accounting Information Systems
   (AIS), using a quantitative method to categorize data through LSA
   (Latent Semantic Analysis) technique; and a qualitative method performed
   by hierarchical categorical content analysis as a basis for inferences.
   We reviewed 309 articles using Institutional Theory in accounting and
   AIS. The LSA results presented the main topics of study, subfields of
   research, and uses of Institutional Theory. Regarding accounting
   research, it is possible to identify the role of institutional forces in
   the IFRS adoption (in private and public sectors), XBRL adoption, and
   disclosure of information on organizations' environmental, social, and
   governance, with a focus on analyses at the organizational level and
   regulatory pressures. A deep dive into AIS articles showed that
   Institutional Theory was applied to analyze the adoption of
   systems/technologies (mostly ERP and XBRL) through isomorphic processes
   (coercive, mimetic, and normative). We proposed to analyze digital
   technologies as an exogenous change for the digital transformation in
   accounting business using another perspective of Institutional Theory:
   institutional change. Institutional change analyzes the role of
   destabilizing elements in the change of an organizational field as a
   whole and not just in a few organizations. In this perspective,
   technology is the agent of change on a broader level, transforming
   organizations, individuals, customers, suppliers, and governments. The
   main contribution of this article is presenting suggestions for future
   AIS. This research agenda contributes to advancing Institutional Theory
   in AIS, using the lens of institutional change to analyze the new
   realities shaping accounting organizations, such as digital
   transformation.},

	abstract = {Digital technologies are radically changing how established
   organizations design novel services. Digital transformation (DT)
   strategies are executed to manage the transition from product-centric to
   service-centric business models based on digital technologies. However,
   little is known about what configurations of DT strategies lead to
   successful digital service innovation (DSI) in established
   organizations. We employ fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis on a
   set of 17 case studies of DT strategies from established organizations
   with different industry backgrounds. We identify several distinct
   configurations of DT strategies that lead to successful and unsuccessful
   DSI. Based on these configurations, we deduce that the threat of digital
   disruption negatively impacts an organization's innovation activities.
   Furthermore, we find that strategic partnerships can be leveraged by
   organizations that face an imminent threat of digital disruption while
   organizations with competitive advantages may rely on
   ``do-it-yourself{''} approaches. Lastly, we find that the involvement of
   a C-level executive is a necessary requirement for successful DSI. Our
   results contribute to theory by integrating research on DSI and DT,
   providing a perspective on DSI failure, and employing a configurational
   research approach that allows us to highlight interdependencies between
   factors as well as insights into the individual factors. Furthermore, we
   provide actionable recommendations for executives.},

	abstract = {Rapid advances in information and communication technologies have
   promoted the evolution of digital governments and the digital
   transformation of firms (DTF). As a provider of public services and a
   regulator, the government is associated closely with the operations of
   firms. However, the manner by which a digital government contributes to
   the DTF remains unknown. In this study, we use a sample of Chinese
   A-share listed firms in 2021 to determine the configurations of digital
   government components that generate different levels of DTF via fuzzy
   set qualitative comparative analysis. Empirical results show that the
   synergy of multiple digital government components, instead of a single
   digital government component, generates high and non-high levels of DTF.
   Additionally, a digital government heterogeneously affects the digital
   transformation of state-owned and non-state-owned firms. Non-state-owned
   firms are more dependent on high-performing digital governments than
   state-owned firms in achieving high levels of DTF. These findings
   contribute to the understanding of the important role of digital
   governments and promote investigations into the driving mechanisms of
   the DTF.},

	abstract = {PurposeAs sustainable performance has a central role in the small and
   medium enterprises (SMEs) performance literature, this study aims to
   examine the influence of networking capabilities in enhancing
   sustainable performance through knowledge workers' productivity and
   digital innovation. It also examines the sequential mediating role of
   knowledge workers' productivity and digital innovation on networking
   capabilities and SMEs' sustainable performance
   relationship.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 308
   knowledge workers in the information technology sector and analyzed
   using the Hayes Process Macro bootstrapping method to test the proposed
   hypotheses.FindingsResults indicate that knowledge workers' productivity
   and digital innovation individually and sequentially mediate the
   relationship between networking capabilities and SME's sustainable
   (economic and environmental) performance, surprisingly, they do not act
   as a mediator between networking capability and SME's social
   performance. SMEs should prioritize investments in the professional
   development of their knowledge workers through training and skill
   enhancement programs. This investment equips knowledge workers with the
   tools to effectively use the knowledge and resources acquired through
   networking. Thus, knowledge workers may improve performance by using
   these resources to tackle challenges.Research
   limitations/implicationsAlthough this research focused on this specific
   context, it is prudent to acknowledge that additional factors may also
   exert influence on sustainable performance within SMEs, factors that
   managers may consider when making decisions. Methodologically, the
   cross-sectional design of this research poses a potential limitation, as
   it does not allow for the complete elimination of endogeneity concerns.
   However, it is worth noting that scholars have endorsed the use of
   cross-sectional data in cases where management researchers aim to expand
   beyond well-documented and longitudinal data sets.Practical
   implicationsThis research offers practical recommendations for SMEs to
   improve their sustainable performance through networking. SMEs should
   seek partnerships with complementary knowledge to improve operations and
   for other performance-oriented benefits.Originality/valueThis study adds
   significantly to the literature on sustainable SME performance by
   studying the interdependent effects of networking capabilities. It also
   represents the individual and sequential mediation mechanism that links
   networking capabilities to SME success through knowledge worker
   productivity and digital innovation.},

	abstract = {Real-time bidding (RTB), which holds bids for advertisers to choose when
   and where to display their advertisements with desired budgets, is one
   way to improve effectiveness. We proposed supply side platform (SSP) and
   demand side platform (DSP) to integrate supplier side and demand side as
   solution. The proposed method combines two digital technology service,
   gamified RTB and mobile location-based analysis (LBA). In order to make
   target customers make interactions actively with the advertisement
   contents, the idea of gamification is employed to increase customer
   participation. By the coupons in the gamifying RTB App, it have
   increased the coupon usage rate of 16.7\% and 11.6\% in the restaurant
   and apparel industries. It is a successfully digital transformation
   marketing service for retail industries. The gamified RTB plays an
   important role in making old business circles accept new technologies
   for the renewal of promotion strategies and help find the business

	abstract = {Digital transformation of services (DTSs) are seen as an opportunity for
   building dynamic capabilities, strategic renewal, collaborative
   approach, changing organization culture, entering new markets, and
   gaining new customers. Understanding users' behavior, preferences, and
   cultural shifts needed for DTS is challenging. Organizations must
   develop new skills, infrastructure, and capabilities to effectively
   design, develop, and implement digital service offerings. To fill such
   gaps, the research explores various enablers and their
   inter-relationships that can empower DTS. The study deploys ``Total

   complex relationships between different enablers and classify them into
   clusters based on impact ability. The proposed model can lead to
   improvements in service delivery, including faster response times,
   personalized services, greater accessibility, and innovation to increase
   digital competencies. By leveraging the study findings, organizations
   can improve their service offerings, respond to changes in demand more
   quickly, maintain high levels of service quality, drive innovation,
   foster collaboration, and deliver more effective customer-centric

	abstract = {Cloud-native is an innovative technology and methodology that is
   necessary to realize the digital transformation of enterprises.
   Promoting the wide adoption of cloud-native in cloud providers and
   enterprises has gained popularity in recent years. According to the
   technological and commercial characteristics of cloud-native, this paper
   analyzes the game relationship between cloud providers and enterprises
   on the selection of cloud-native, and combines evolutionary game theory
   to establish a model. In addition, empirical analysis indicates the
   impact of parameter changes on the dynamic evolution process. The
   results show that (1) enterprises are more vulnerable to the impact of
   direct benefit to adopt cloud-native, and cloud providers are especially
   affected by the cost of providing cloud-native; (2) enterprises are more
   likely to be impacted by the invisible benefit than cloud providers, but
   the impact has a marginal decreasing effect; (3) the low price is one of
   the reasons to attract enterprises; (4) enterprises are more concerned
   about the potential loss caused by the supply and demand mismatch. The
   results of the discussion provide a reference for all stakeholders to
   promote the implementation of cloud-native and the digital
   transformation of enterprises.},

	abstract = {Given the resource-intensive nature of automotive manufacturing
   processes and their potential to substantially contribute to ecological
   footprints, the integration of sustainable logistic practices in the
   context of digital transformation becomes imperative. This paper focuses
   on the implementation of green supply chain strategies within the
   automotive sector, targeting significant risks associated with
   environmental impact, specifically in the critical domain of automotive
   paint shops. Automotive paint shops indeed play a significant part in
   determining the overall sustainability of automotive production.
   Recognized for their role in vehicle esthetics and corrosion protection,
   the sustainable integration of these facilities is crucial in the
   pursuit of a greener automotive future. A comprehensive multi-criteria
   decision-making framework is herein proposed as a valuable tool in
   pinpointing the most critical barriers to digital transformation and
   simultaneously prioritizing suitable green logistic strategies in the
   context of automotive paint shop risk-management procedures. The
   practical utility of the model extends to practitioners in the
   automotive paint shop supply chain, particularly those engaged in
   digitalizing critical operations, facilitating well-informed
   decision-making aligned with environmental sustainability goals. The
   findings of this research highlight the critical importance of
   implementing tailored strategies, including crisis preparedness,
   transparent communication, proactive outreach, and strategic investments
   in technology and partnerships, to address barriers and enhance
   sustainability practices within automotive paint shop operations,
   thereby contributing to the overall resilience and long-term viability

	abstract = {Collaboration is increasingly perceived as essential for digital
   transformation in the public sector. Transforming services and internal
   operations through the use of information and communication technologies
   frequently requires the engagement of multiple stakeholders beyond
   government agencies. This is particularly important in the specific case
   of smart city initiatives, which intend to leverage technologies to
   address complex socio-economic and sustainability challenges in local
   jurisdictions. In addition, emergent research asserts that community
   organizations such as public libraries can be strategic partners in
   these multi-actor efforts but does not adequately assess the
   determinants of these collaborations for developing smart cities, which
   may result in significant digital transformation at the local level.
   Based on public management literature on collaboration, this article
   contributes to digital transformation research by quantitively testing
   the antecedents of existing collaborations between public libraries and
   other stakeholders to develop smart cities. Overall, our findings
   suggest that leadership, preexisting relationships, and agreement on
   initial aims significantly impact the extent and effectiveness of public

	abstract = {Prefabricated construction is revolutionizing the industry by promoting
   efficiency and sustainability through off-site manufacturing and on-site
   assembly. Despite its potential, the digital transformation of
   prefabricated construction supply chains (PCSCs) has not kept pace with
   Industry 4.0 advancements, resulting in fragmented information and
   operational inefficiencies. Even more, limited attention has been paid
   to establishing both a well-structured readiness model for PCSC digital
   transformation and an actionable assessment framework. This study
   addresses this gap by developing a comprehensive, multi-level readiness
   model tailored specifically for PCSCs, encompassing dimensions of
   technology, strategy, partnership, and personnel. To accurately evaluate
   digital transformation readiness, we propose a fairness-aware
   bi-objective optimization model that aggregates probabilistic expert
   opinions while considering individual behavioral factors related to
   fairness concerns. The model was applied in a case study of a PCSC
   project, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness. Results
   validated the model's capability to provide a robust readiness
   assessment, identifying critical areas for improvement and offering
   actionable insights for stakeholders. This research fills a critical gap
   in the literature by providing practical guidance for PCSCs embarking on
   their digital transformation journey. The proposed framework serves as a
   valuable tool for organizations seeking to transition to digital supply

	abstract = {This study explores the strategic drivers of digital transformation (DT)
   at subsidiaries. Our research framework derives strategic drivers from a
   tripod model that integrates the resource-based, the institution-based,
   and the industry-based views. We use two longitudinal case studies at
   global automotive suppliers' Hungarian subsidiaries. We found that each
   view highlights a different set of strategic drivers. DT in the
   subsidiaries is boosted by proactive local management and mature process
   improvement routines (dynamic capabilities); parent-pull relation
   (internal institutions) and state support attracting manufacturing FDI
   (external institutions); as well as buyers' increasing expectations and
   supplier-related factors (industry-based view). By combining these
   views, we claim that drivers related to the external institutional
   context and the industrial competition are usually filtered by the
   global management before contributing to resource adjustments at
   subsidiaries in a coercive top-down manner. Despite this seemingly
   deterministic DT process, local managements can actively shape DT, even

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 (I4.0) literature has been concerned with how to implement
   digital technologies in manufacturing processes. However, the I4.0
   concept also comprises broader changes in the company's business model
   (BM) through digital transformation, which deserves more attention,
   especially from the technology providers' perspective. As they are
   essential to advancing the digital transformation diffusion and creating
   I4.0 ecosystems, their business model innovation (BMI) in this context
   is a keystone for I4.0. Thus, we consider how changing factors in the
   I4.0 context affect the business model dimensions of technology
   providers. We analyze changing factors in the three main BM dimensions:
   front-end, back-end, and value proposition. We study ten I4.0 technology
   providers and explain the mechanisms of change involved in their BMI,
   explaining how and why such changes happen. The findings provide
   practitioners with insights to anticipate the necessary actions to
   manage and incorporate such changes, whether they rely more on data and
   IoT devices, new BMs such as training and consulting, dynamic pricing
   forms, new software/hardware, or service competencies. We also provide a
   detailed analysis of elements of change in the BM that can be used in
   theory to understand better the different digital transformation impacts
   in the Industry 4.0 context.},

	abstract = {In the service sector, digital platforms now enable service providers to
   reach customers through an online marketplace and use the value-adding
   complementary services offered. However, despite the widespread
   prevalence of digital platforms, there has been little research on the
   market reach and financial performance captured by service providers. We
   explored these service provider-specific outcomes of digital platforms
   by studying a digital platform in the beauty industry. Our results show
   that digital platforms present a troubling paradox for service providers
   participating in a platform-based online marketplace: despite increases
   in market reach, in terms of a higher rate of new customer acquisition,
   those service providers participating in the marketplace have lower
   sales than others. However, the `dark side' of this paradox is
   compensated by higher sales for service providers using more of the
   complementary services offered by the platform. Hence, although digital
   platforms may open new markets and add value, service providers should
   be wary of their paradoxical consequences. With these findings, we
   contribute new theoretical and managerial insight about the service
   provider-specific outcomes of digital platforms and add to the ongoing
   debate about firm strategies in the digital age concerning the platform
   economy.},

	abstract = {Digitally transformed firms show resilience against environmental
   volatility by regularly developing adaptive capabilities and
   transforming their processes to mitigate the effects of obsolescence.
   However, there is a lack of conceptual clarity on the obsolescence
   notion and means of avoiding it. This paper aims to investigate how
   firms' empirical sensitivities to evolving environmental changes emerge
   and materialize into the ongoing management of obsolescence. We
   undertook an interpretive longitudinal study between 2009 and 20,
   capturing both the transformation journey and the habitus of a high-tech
   SME, which is a family business and located in the UK. In doing so, we
   develop an integrative framework to explain the interplay between the
   noncognitive dynamic capabilities, obsolescence, and digital
   transformation. This study has important implications to boost SMEs'
   capacity to counter obsolescence. We suggest managers pay attention to
   the development of noncognitive dy-namic capabilities. This, in turn,
   inadvertently leads to successful digital transformation for
   obsolescence trap avoidance.},

	abstract = {The literature on the antecedents of successful data-driven digital
   transformations needs clarity on if and how employees' cognitions and
   behaviours have any bearing on data-driven digital transformations with
   implications for operational productivity. This paper addresses this gap
   by drawing on socio-cognitive theory to examine how employees'
   cognitions (psychological safety) shape individual behaviours
   (employee-led process improvement) to affect organisational attainments
   such as data-driven digital transformations and operational
   productivity. A theoretical framework linking psychological safety to
   operational productivity through individual and serial mediations of
   `employee-led process improvement' and `data-driven digital
   transformation' is statistically tested by collecting survey data from
   183 healthcare providers in Australia. The results indicate that when
   employees' perceptions of interpersonal risks are allayed (psychological
   safety), it has a significant positive effect on operational
   productivity directly and indirectly through the individual and serial
   mediations of employee-led process improvement and data-driven digital
   transformations. The socio-cognitive theorisation of psychological
   safety as the driving mechanism that facilitates employee-led process
   improvement, data-driven digital transformation and operational
   productivity is a first in the academic literature with implications for
   both theory and practice.},

	abstract = {Under Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) system, it's crucial for
   all healthcare providers to accurately submit medical expense claims to
   the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) to avoid incorrect
   deductions. With changes in healthcare policies and adjustments in
   hospital management strategies, the complexity of claiming rules has
   resulted in hospitals expending significant manpower and time on the
   medical expense claims process. Therefore, this study utilizes the Lean
   Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) management
   approach to identify wasteful and non-value-added steps in the process.
   Simultaneously, it introduces Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools to
   replace manual operations. After implementation, the study effectively
   reduces the process time by 380 min and enhances Process Cycle
   Efficiency (PCE) from 69.07 to 95.54\%. This research validates a
   real-world case of Lean digital transformation in healthcare
   institutions. It enables human resources to be allocated to more
   valuable and creative tasks while assisting hospitals in providing more
   comprehensive and patient-centric services.},

	abstract = {The growing environmental business uncertainties have forced companies
   to focus on developing more flexible supply chains. Digital
   transformation has been considered a key means to achieving such
   flexibility, but the literature lacks empirical evidence about how
   digital technologies effectively contribute to it. Thus, this study aims
   to analyze how Smart Supply Chain (i.e., a supply chain enabled by
   digital transformation) contributes to supply chain flexibility and
   operational performance in environments surrounded by customer and
   supplier uncertainty. We adopt the organizational information-processing
   theory to explain the fit between information needs to reduce these
   uncertainties through more supply chain flexibility (sourcing, delivery,
   and manufacturing) and information capabilities provided by three main
   dimensions of the Smart Supply Chain (digital transformation strategy,
   digital base technologies, and digital front-end technologies). We
   relate these information-processing fit between Smart Supply Chain and
   flexibility with the boundary conditions of envi-ronmental uncertainty
   and operational performance improvements. Such relationships are
   analyzed through moderation and mediation regression tests based on 379
   manufacturing companies surveyed. Our findings show that Smart Supply
   Chain has a statistical association with operational performance through
   the sequential mediating role of the three supply chain flexibility
   dimensions. We also found that environments with high customer
   uncertainty increase the use of base technologies (IoT, cloud, big data,
   AI, and blockchain) to reach delivery flexibility and support
   manufacturing flexibility. When companies face high supplier
   uncertainty, they use front-end technologies (i.e., robotics, 3D
   printing, simulation, and augmented reality) to increase sourcing
   flexibility. We show new advances in supply chain flexibility through
   digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation (DT) is an emergent concept with definitions and
   measurements as a work in progress. During nearly two decades of growing
   interest in the concept, studies in both industry and academia created
   different scales and indices to measure DT, using varying
   conceptualizations and coming up with different underlying dimensions
   and indicators. The aim of this paper is to take stock of this growing
   body of work through a systematic review in order to first determine
   dimensions and indicators of an encompassing DT index, and then identify
   the contemporary change in underlying dimensions of DT. After reviewing
   219 research articles on DT measurement in the first phase, we have
   identified 80 indicators falling under 14 different dimensions. In the
   second phase, we have compared our results with scales commonly used in
   the field and identified several emergent dimensions, such as cyber
   security, investment and finance operations, and partnerships. Emergence
   of these contemporary dimensions indicate an `extrovert' shift in DT
   concept which is extending beyond organisational boundaries, with
   important implications regarding how businesses strategize and take
   action in today's DT driven business environment.},

	abstract = {During times of crisis, businesses need strategic partnerships and
   digital transformation to survive. Understanding how digital
   transformation and alliance management capability can work together to
   enhance supply chain capabilities during a crisis is important. We have
   developed a theoretical framework that explains how the alliance
   management capability, under the mediating influence of digital
   transformation, helps build supply chain capabilities for unprecedented
   crises. This framework highlights key enablers such as alliance
   management capability, digital transformation, supply chain agility, and
   supply chain adaptability that are essential for organisational
   performance. We tested our theoretical model using a survey of 157
   individuals working in the manufacturing industry in India. Our findings
   suggest that combining alliance management capability and digital
   transformation enhances supply chain capabilities, which improves an
   organisation's ability to respond to crises. Moreover, digital
   transformation, supply chain agility, and adaptability are critical
   determinants of organisational performance during crises. Therefore,
   companies that use digital technologies to increase their agility and
   adaptability are more likely to perform well during times of crisis. To
   collect qualitative data, we interviewed key participants (n = 27) and
   identified four key enablers for a digital transformation strategy for
   supply chains: coordination, digital leadership, digital culture, and
   digital talent management. Our study offers a detailed understanding of
   the dynamic capability view in digital transformation, highlighting key
   drivers for competitive advantage.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation (DT) is revolutionizing building facility
   management (FM) by streamlining operations, maximizing resources, and
   increasing performance. FM firms prioritize DT to stay competitive as
   speed and efficiency become more crucial in the corporate context.
   Traditional FM methods like manual record-keeping and reactive
   maintenance cannot meet recent corporate needs. Modern technologies such
   as IoT, AI, digital twins, and data analytics enable real-time building
   asset monitoring and optimization. This paper evaluates the digital
   transformation readiness level index of building facility management
   (DTRLIBFM), which includes critical success factors for DT development,
   using structural equation modeling (SEM). DTRLIBFM model determines the
   importance of key factors that contribute to the success of digital
   transformation initiatives, specifically focusing on the DT readiness
   level index of building facility management. Expert interviews and an
   intensive literature review were employed to identify the critical
   success factors for the DTRLIFMB. The Delphi technique was employed to
   validate these factors with 13 highly experienced professionals, and
   they were subsequently appraised for significance through an online
   questionnaire that was circulated to industry experts. To quantitatively
   evaluate the interconnectedness of different elements of DTRLIFMB and
   establish the impact of each construct on the overall digital
   transformation, data from 220 participants from around the world were
   analyzed using (SEM). The evaluation included reliability, validity,
   hypothesis testing, multivariate normality, and goodness-of-fit indexes.
   The DTRLIBFM model, with 20 indicators in three constructs, explains how
   DT readiness affects a building's digitalization importance level. The
   research provides governments, organizations, contractors, consultants,
   suppliers, subcontractors, and facility managers with a current DT index
   and DT roadmap for building facility management.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The agri-food system is undergoing pervasive changes in
   business models, facilitated by the use of digital technologies.
   Although today it is almost inevitable for any business to adopt some
   level of digital transformation to strengthen their competitiveness,
   this transition in the agri-food sector could be more complex, given its
   characteristics.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to analyse worldwide
   the perceptions of new digital technologies in the agri-food sector
   expressed within social media platforms, identifying the differences
   that may exist between them regarding its objectives and social
   acceptance.METHODS: This paper examines the information regarding
   digital transformation process in the agri-food sector disseminated
   worldwide on Twitter. For that purpose, Twitter API is used to gather
   tweets and descriptive and content analyses, including a sentiment
   analysis, are performed using R and MAXQDA software.RESULTS AND
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that the digitalization of the agri-food sector is
   broadly discussed within Twitter. Different actors participate in these
   information flows, being companies and digital solution providers the
   most active users and academics and governmental institutions the most
   visible. Artificial Intel-ligence was the most mentioned technology,
   that together with the Internet of Things, Big Data, Machine Learning,
   and Cloud Computing, was related to improving production efficiencies,
   crop yield, or cost reduction. In the case of Blockchain Technology, it
   was closer to food supply chain actors, such as distribution companies
   and marketers. However, all these technologies are connected to the
   concept of sustainability. The sentiment analysis showed a generally
   positive tone, indicating social acceptance regarding the starting phase
   of the adoption of these technologies. The study also identified
   differences among countries, pointing to a stronger level of engagement
   with these technologies in developed regions. Moreover, the COVID-19
   pandemic was seen as a chance to boost the digital transformation in the
   sector all over the world.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that
   data harvested from Twitter provide useful insight into perceptions of
   digital transformation and different digital technologies in the
   agri-food value chain across different countries. Information that could
   be useful for researchers, but also for agricultural firms and
   policymakers.},

   supplier business (DASB), and household. DASB and SOIB are both assumed
   to supply one product to the economy and fundamentally differ among each
   other in their business models. While the sustainable oriented
   innovation business produces and sells capital goods making revenue out
   of sales, digital asset supplier detaches the concept of production from
   sales moving toward an intangible economy, charging for a fee licence of
   their tools that can be distributed via a network economy. Simulations
   show the level of flexibility of the model in addressing a variety of
   scenarios, playing at the threshold of technology development,
   inequality rise, massive unemployment and providing an archetype for
   sustainable oriented innovation and digital transformation models. The
   findings suggested by the model analysis are used to infer conclusions
   for the wider society, including implications for sustainable oriented
   businesses and digital transformation. These are confirmed by previous
   studies, around the overall trend in wealth creation for large
   technology firms' owners, potential impact for employment in the digital
   economy, and transformation for the labour market.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in digital transformation (DX) in the industrial
   sector have spotlighted digital collaborative factories, which emphasize
   relationships with partners, particularly in the manufacturing sector.
   However, existing DX maturity assessment models primarily focus on
   evaluating individual companies, lacking consideration of partnerships
   and thereby failing to reflect the complexities of collaborative
   systems. To address this limitation, this study aims to develop a DX
   maturity assessment model tailored to digital collaborative factories
   while accounting for collaborative relationships. Initially, 25 existing
   DX maturity assessment models were reviewed, and the evaluation elements
   related to collaboration were extracted from each. Accordingly, the
   maturity assessment model was created with 15 evaluation factors,
   including organizational aspects, process management, quality control,
   and logistics operations. Finally, to verify the applicability of the
   model, the DX maturity levels of a lead company-a forklift-manufacturing
   company-and its partner-an automotive component manufacturer-within the
   same value chain were assessed, and the model's suitability was
   evaluated. The results indicate that the lead company needed to improve
   on the intelligence, connectivity, and automation aspects, while its
   partner needs to streamline production process operations and
   technological connectivity. This approach enables manufacturers to
   obtain more reliable information in resolving issues arising from
   collaboration with partners, as well as in establishing future
   strategies. The findings suggest that strengthening collaboration
   systems among partners and advancing DX based on digital collaboration
   will raise competitiveness within the manufacturing sector.},

	abstract = {In the context of comprehensive business systems engineering,
   manufacturers must establish and maintain robust relationships with
   suppliers and customers in order to remain competitive. This paper
   introduces a Neutrosophic BWM-TOPSIS framework for supplier evaluation,
   addressing the uncertainty inherent to multi-attribute decision-making
   (MADM) during digital transformation (DX). By integrating Neutrosophic
   sets, which extend fuzzy logic, this framework effectively deals with
   ambiguous, inconsistent, and incomplete data. Additionally, it
   incorporates the Best-Worst Method (BWM) with the purpose of determining
   the weights for decision-makers and deploys the Technique for Order of
   Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to rank supplier
   alternatives. A case study carried out for the metro rail coach
   manufacturing industry validates the framework's practical application,
   showcasing its ability to enhance decision-making accuracy. Moreover,
   this study compares the performance of the proposed framework to that of
   existing approaches in terms of informativeness and reliability. This
   research significantly contributes to the field of informatics by
   providing a scalable and systematic decision-making methodology, which
   can also be adapted to other MADM contexts in DX.},

	abstract = {Patient information leaflets (PILs) are vital for conveying treatment
   details and ensuring patient safety and adherence. Traditional
   paper-based PILs fall short due to their complexity, specific national
   requirements, and dated content, posing challenges for pharmaceutical
   manufacturers such as supply flexibility, resource-intensive updates,
   and environmental impact. The rapidly evolving digital technologies
   provide promising opportunities for transforming traditional paper-based
   PIL into electronic PIL (ePIL), addressing the current limitations and
   creating value-adding propositions for involved stakeholders. This paper
   examines digital transformation of ePIL within a highly regulated
   environment from the perspective of multinational pharmaceutical
   manufacturers. We use a hybrid Delphi approach, merging reviews and
   interviews, to explore the dynamic capability microfoundations involved
   when transitioning from paper-based to digital systems from an
   operations management perspective. A maturity model is introduced to
   gauge the extent of transformation maturity in a regulated setting. This
   paper offers valuable insights for managers and policymakers seeking to
   develop dynamic capabilities for ePIL digital transformation and
   evaluate operational maturity. Additionally, benchmarking current and

	abstract = {q-spherical fuzzy rough set (q-SFRS) is also one of the fundamental
   concepts for addressing more uncertainties in decision problems than the
   existing structures of fuzzy sets, and thus its implementation was more
   substantial. The well-known sine trigonometric function maintains the
   periodicity and symmetry of the origin in nature and thus satisfies the
   expectations of the experts over the multi-parameters. Taking this
   feature and the significance of the q-SFRSs into consideration, the main
   objective of the article is to describe some reliable sine trigonometric
   laws for SFSs. Associated with these laws, we develop new average and
   geometric aggregation operators to aggregate the q-spherical fuzzy rough
   numbers. Then, we presented a group decision-making strategy to address
   the multi-attribute group decision-making problem using the developed
   aggregation operators. To verify the value of the defined operators, a
   MAGDM strategy is provided along with applications for selecting a Cloud
   Service Provider and a Digital Transformation Vendor for digital
   transformation. Moreover, a comparative study is also performed to

	abstract = {Service-oriented manufacturing (SOM) is a new paradigm that merges
   manufacturing and service, leading to supply chain diversification (SCD)
   with components such as supplier, customer, and product diversification.
   Building SCD is imperative for SOM firms as a proactive strategy. Our
   study investigates the role of digital transformation (DT) in building
   SCD for SOM firms, while also examining the moderating effects of
   information quality and environment uncertainty. Our methodology
   involves collecting data from 819 A-listed SOM firms announced by
   governing bodies between 2017 and 2021. We utilised ordinary least
   squares (OLS) regression models with fixed effects to test our
   hypotheses. Our findings indicate that DT enhances SCD, encompassing
   supplier, customer, and product diversification. The positive effects of
   DT on SCD are amplified in conditions of higher information quality and
   lower environmental uncertainty. However, in contexts characterised by
   low environmental uncertainty, SCD performance may suffer. These results
   hold practical implications for researchers and practitioners involved
   in SCD management.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many countries to implement a variety
   of restrictive measures to prevent it from spreading more widely,
   including the introduction of medical teleconsultations and the use of
   various tools in the field of inpatient telemedicine care. Digital
   technologies provide a wide range of treatment options for patients, and
   at the same time pose a number of organizational challenges for medical
   entities. Therefore, the question arises of whether organizations are
   ready to use modern telemedicine tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   aim of this article is to examine two factors that impact the level of
   organizational e-readiness for digital transformation in Polish primary
   healthcare providers (PHC). The first factor comprises operational
   capabilities, which are the sum of valuable, scarce, unique, and
   irreplaceable resources and the ability to use them. The second factor
   comprises technological capabilities, which determine the adoption and
   usage of innovative technologies. Contrary to the commonly analyzed
   impacts of technology on operational capabilities, we state the reverse
   hypothesis. The verification confirms the significant influence of
   operational capabilities on technological capabilities. The research is
   conducted using a questionnaire covering organizational e-readiness for
   digital transformation prepared by the authors. Out of the 32 items
   examined, four are related to the operational capabilities and four to
   the technological capabilities. The result of our evaluation shows that:
   (i) a basic set of four variables can effectively measure the dimensions
   of OC, namely the degree of agility, level of process integration,
   quality of resources, and quality of cooperation; (ii) a basic set of
   three variables can effectively measure the dimensions of TC, namely
   adoption and usage of technologies, customer interaction, and process
   automation; (iii) the empirical results show that OC is on a higher
   level than TC in Polish PHCs; (iv) the assessment of the relationship
   between OC and TC reveals a significant influence of operational
   capabilities on technological capabilities with a structural coefficient
   of 0.697. We recommend increasing the level of technological capability
   in PHC providers in order to improve the contact between patients and
   general practitioners (GPs) via telemedicine in lockdown conditions.},

	abstract = {Background Global health systems are confronting challenges that
   intersect climate change with evolving communicable and non-communicable
   public health risks. Addressing these challenges requires systems
   integration via citizen big data that exist outside health systems.
   However, systems integration across jurisdictions is a complex challenge
   that requires stakeholder input. This study's purpose was to conduct
   rapid systems mapping with international health system stakeholders to
   inform the development and implementation of a global digital citizen
   science observatory (DiScO), which aims to catalyze digital
   transformation of health systems across jurisdictions.Methods A rapid
   qualitative systems mapping study was conducted during the International
   Society for Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity Annual Global
   Summit in Uppsala, Sweden, in June 2023. The choice of the venue and
   approach was informed by three key criteria: (1) Established evidence
   linking physical activity and nutrition with non-communicable diseases;
   (2) Concrete existing methods of obtaining citizen big data by physical
   activity and nutrition researchers; (3) Precedence of physical activity
   and nutrition researchers conducting citizen science as well
   behavioral/clinical big data collection. The design of this study was an
   innovative pre-post systems map development, which consisted of (1)
   real-time rapid systems mapping (pre/initial map) by engaging with
   international stakeholders and (2) adjustment of the real-time systems
   map (post/final map) after analyzing stakeholder discussion data.Results
   Rapid systems mapping resulted in a complex network that included key
   themes to successfully develop and implement DiScO: priorities,
   opportunities, risks, challenges, partnerships, and resources.
   Additionally, a new theme emerged organically through stakeholder group
   discussions - mitigation strategies. The adapted rapid systems map
   (i.e., after data analyses) depicts 23 key nodes of intervention across
   the seven key themes.Conclusion Rapid systems mapping at international
   symposia is a novel methodological approach to capture stakeholder
   input, particularly to understand complexity across international
   jurisdictions - an approach that can be replicated across disciplines
   and sectors to inform digital transformation of health systems. The
   development and implementation of DiScO, a platform for decentralization
   and democratization of technology, will take into consideration all the
   key nodes of intervention identified in the rapid systems map to promote
   digital health for equity across global jurisdictions.},

	abstract = {PurposeThe aim of this study was to identify interventions for and
   mechanisms of the digital transformation of purchasing and supply
   management (PSM) processes. The digital transformation of tactical and
   operational PSM processes has often progressed slowly despite the solid
   knowledge of advanced technologies.Design/methodology/approachThis study
   used a qualitative exploratory approach based on 14 interviews with PSM
   executives from firms that are continuously working toward using
   advanced technologies in their PSM processes but have not yet gained
   full strategic benefits from digital transformation.FindingsThis study
   formulates five propositions regarding interventions and mechanisms that
   can positively influence the digital transformation of PSM processes.
   The main intervention in this regard is the renewal of data
   infrastructure, including platforms. PSM-related data should meet needs
   from both tactical and operational viewpoints. When applications serve
   as a source of data, they support digital transformation. Mechanisms
   such as supplier measurement and process improvement are outcomes of the
   digital transformation of PSM processes.Practical implicationsThis study
   highlights the importance of common data sets for tactical and
   operational purchasing. These purchasing data should be owned and served
   by a cross-functional team. To create this interoperability, a firm
   needs global governance of open standards.Originality/valueThis study
   makes a theoretical contribution to the discussion of what kind of
   interventions positively influence on the digital transformation of PSM
   processes. Specifically, this study explains the integration needs of
   data and applications.},

   recap the tremendous effort that was required by the company to obtain
   high-quality results for economic change when a partner is transforming

	abstract = {While awareness among managers regarding the benefits of digital
   transformation in supply chain management has grown, many Chinese SMEs
   have not fully embraced this shift due to ineffective ICT investments, a
   lack of effective government support, and the presence of related
   cognitive challenges. Leveraging a sample of 302 SMEs in China, the
   study employs SEM techniques to validate the direct effect of ICTs on
   the digital integration capability, and the relationship between the
   digital integration capability and firm financial performance.
   Furthermore, the LMS technique is applied to investigate the moderating
   role of government support and cognitive constraints within these
   relationships. Result shows that: (1) ICTs positively affect firm's
   supply chain digital integration capability; (2) firm's supply chain
   digital integration capability positively affects firm financial
   performance; (3) perceived government support exhibits an antagonistic
   effect, hindering the promotion of supply chain digital integration
   capabilities through ICT infrastructures; (4) Certain cognitive
   constraints related to digital transformation act as negative moderators
   within the digital transformation process. Through the exploration of
   two previously overlooked factors, namely perceived government support
   and cognitive constraints related to digital transformation, our
   research contributes to a deepened understanding of dynamic capability
   theory, social cognitive theory, and organizational inertia theory. Our
   findings suggest that government policymakers must reassess the
   effectiveness and objectives of policies in the digital transformation
   journey. Furthermore, firms are urged to acknowledge and address the
   potential adverse effects of cognitive constraints within their
   organizations and among their supply chain partners. Emphasizing the
   importance of digital integration capability is also crucial.
   In this research, we investigated the digital transformation challenges
   faced by SMEs in China, with a focus on 302 manufacturing SMEs in the
   Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Economic Belt. The study aimed to
   examine the necessity for SMEs to extend their focus beyond mere
   investment in ICTs toward enhancing digital integration capabilities to
   achieve improved financial performance. Additionally, it explored how
   SMEs' perceptions of government support and cognitive constraints
   influence the relationship between ICTs and digital integration
   capability, as well as the impact of cognitive constraints on the link
   between digital integration capability and firm financial performance.
   The findings were clear: ICT infrastructures significantly enhance the
   digital integration capability of supply chains, leading to improved
   financial performance in SMEs. However, this process is complicated by
   SMEs' perceptions of government support, which can inadvertently impede
   the development of digital integration capabilities. The study also
   highlights the existence of cognitive constraints hindering digital
   transformation. These insights are crucial for business managers,
   suggesting a shift in focus from solely investing in ICT to fostering
   digital integration capabilities within their supply chains and
   recognizing the impact of cognitive constraints on digital
   transformation efforts. For government policymakers, the findings
   underscore the need to reassess the efficacy and goals of support
   policies in the digital transformation journey of SMEs.},

	abstract = {The development of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) retail has
   demonstrated an evolution of buyer-seller interactions. In the era of
   digital transformation, FMCGs and micro, small, and medium enterprises
   (MSMEs) can easily use website applications to shop for various products
   from suppliers, make payments, and access a wider variety of products
   with more efficient delivery. However, empirical studies on loyalty
   drivers on B2B relationships for business sustainability in the retail
   industry have not received much attention. This research aimed to
   examine the factors that influence loyalty and analyze the mediating
   role of MSME loyalty by discussing a new conceptual framework designed
   based on the buyer-seller relationship theory and relational marketing.
   Data were collected from 500 owners or managers of FMCG retail stalls in
   various provinces in Indonesia and analyzed using structural equation
   modeling (SEM). The results showed that merchandising, website quality,
   commitment, and satisfaction have a positive effect on loyalty, as
   opposed to service quality and trust. There are also different roles in
   the mediating variables of trust, commitment, and satisfaction on retail
   store loyalty. These findings were useful for policymakers, managers,
   and practitioners to clarify the influence of service quality,
   merchandising website quality, and the role of relationship quality on
   loyalty in the era of digital transformation.},

	abstract = {In this study of the U.S. automobile industry, we highlight the way the
   division of innovative labor across firms in the supply chain can be
   influenced by a particular form of digital innovation known as ``digital
   control systems.{''} Digital control systems are becoming ubiquitous in
   complex products, and these digital innovations integrate other
   components across a product structure and introduce a level of
   indeterminacy and unpredictability in the organization of the interfirm
   division of innovative labor. Much of organizational scholarship holds
   that accompanying a shift toward increasingly modular product
   structures, component suppliers are engaging in relatively more design
   and invention around the components that they supply. We find that the
   evolution of digital controls may reverse this pattern, because in the
   wake of a major shift in the digital. controls technology, suppliers
   actually engage in relatively less component innovation in comparison
   with their large manufacturing customers. To explain this shift, we
   characterize complex product structures in terms of two distinct product
   hierarchies: the inclusionary and the digital control hierarchy. In
   using this distinction to analyze the evolution of automotive emission
   control systems from 1970 to 1998, we reconcile two competing views
   about the interfirm division of innovative labor.},

   transformation on supply chain efficiency. We find that firms with a
   higher degree of digital transformation are associated with higher
   supply chain efficiency. Mechanism tests show that digital
   transformation facilitates supply chain efficiency via lower customer
   demand uncertainty as well as raw material disruption risk. The positive
   effect of digital transformation is more pronounced for non-state-owned
   enterprises and for firms with less stable customers and more
   geographically dispersed suppliers. Moreover, there is much degree
   prompt in supply chain efficiency for firms located in a better digital
   environment. This paper sheds light on how digital transformation

   Information Systems in Portugal at a time when technologies enable the
   creation of new approaches and models for care provision, as well as to
   identify scenarios that may characterize this practice in the future.
   Design/methodology/approach: A guiding research model was created based
   on an empirical study that was conducted using a qualitative method that
   integrated content analysis of strategic documents and semi-structured
   interviews with a sample of fourteen key actors in the health sector.
   Findings: Results pointed to the existence of emerging technologies that
   may promote the development of Health Information Systems oriented to
   ``health and well-being{''} in a preventive model logic and reinforce
   the social and management implications. Originality/value: The
   originality of this work resided in the empirical study carried out,
   which allowed us to analyze how the various actors look at the present
   and the future of Health Information Systems. There is also a lack of
   studies addressing this subject. Research limitations/implications: The
   main limitations resulted from a low, although representative, number of
   interviews and the fact that the interviews took place before the
   pandemic, so the digital transformation that was promoted was not
   reflected. Managerial implications and social implications: The study
   highlighted the need for greater commitment from decision makers,
   managers, healthcare providers, and citizens toward achieving improved
   digital literacy and health. Decision makers and managers must also
   agree on strategies to accelerate existing strategic plans and avoid
   their implementation at different paces.},

	abstract = {The use of smartphone apps has numerous advantages for app providers and

   trade-off between usage benefits and preferences for personal data
   protection. We investigate the acceptability of data sharing in
   different vignettes describing five types of these apps from key
   industries of the digital transformation. The vignettes are embedded in
   a representative survey for the German population (N =1,013). For each
   vignette we examine to what extent the acceptance of data sharing
   differs with respect to potential recipients, collected information
   attributes, and the promoted benefits of data sharing. We differentiate
   the promoted benefits in two treatments according to monetary (or
   personal) and environmental (or public) benefits. Our results show no
   treatment effects but significant differences in acceptance values for
   different recipients and information attributes. We further observe that
   participants with stronger green consumption values, participants with a
   stronger risk propensity, men, and younger participants show a higher
   acceptance towards data sharing in the described scenarios.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation (DX) has driven significant company changes,
   restructuring products, processes, and services by integrating emerging
   technologies across all organisational levels. This change enhances
   workflows, decision-making, and operational efficiency, fostering
   innovation and competitive advantage. This research analyses how
   effective technology implementation, employee engagement, usability
   awareness, and strategic management practices can improve organisational
   processes. By analysing interconnections among DX, human factors,
   business processes, and emerging technologies, the research employs a
   systematic literature review and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to
   identify critical factors for success. The findings highlight that
   digital tools streamline operations and support data-driven decisions,
   reducing cognitive overload through user-centred design. This research
   proposes a Human-Oriented Process Enhancement (H.O.P.E.) model that
   integrates DX with human-centric factors to guide digital technology
   applications and improve organisational performance. The practical
   application of this model was carried out as part of a litigation
   management project in an automotive supplier manufacturing plant
   specialising in advanced solutions across seating, interiors, and clean
   mobility technologies. The project sought to streamline legal processes,
   enhance compliance, and mitigate risks through structured litigation
   management. In conclusion, the digital maturity and human factors (DMHF)
   index, the outcome of the H.O.P.E. model, has proven to be a
   comprehensive tool for aligning DX adoption with organisational
   strategic goals considering human-centric factors. Future research will
   focus on customising the index for industry-specific needs, particularly
   ergonomics, to ensure organisations achieve sustainable growth in a
   digital setting.},

	abstract = {The aim of this research is to examine the factors that affect the
   digital transformation (DT) adoption in small and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs) in Danang, Vietnam, using the
   Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and PLS-SEM
   approach. Notwithstanding the growing attention towards the adoption of
   DT, there is a dearth of comprehensive research that examines the
   combined impact of environmental, organizational, and technological
   factors on DT adoption within SMEs. Therefore, this study aims to fill
   this gap by building upon the existing literature to provide
   quantitative evidence on the adoption of DT in SMEs. The findings of our
   study indicate that implementing DT in SMEs is impacted by a confluence
   of factors, including environmental, organizational, and technological
   considerations. Specifically, technological factors such as
   cybersecurity and IT integration capabilities, environmental factors
   such as clients and partnerships, and organizational capabilities such
   as top management support and governance, have a significant positive
   impact on DT adoption. The study also uncovers that technological
   factors play a mediating role in the relationship between organizational
   and environmental factors in the adoption of DT by SMEs. The present
   study enhances the existing knowledge on the adoption of DT in SMEs by
   conducting a thorough examination of the factors that affect DT
   adoption. The study underscores the significance of considering both
   technical and organizational factors while executing DT initiatives and
   identifies potential areas for further investigation.},

	abstract = {Previous research has pointed out that Industry 4.0 will lead to more
   sustainable production; however, it may have profound effects on
   European competitiveness. Today, firms in the CEE countries face a
   limited scope for continued economic expansion, and hence there is a
   growing pressure on them to move upward in the global value chain by
   investing heavily in advanced technology. Consequently, the authors
   argue that B2B firms from the CEE countries can have a massive impact on
   Europe's long-term competitiveness by reversing the effect of digital
   transformation due to their strong interdependencies on other European
   economies. Therefore, in a cross-country survey, research data were
   collected (n = 302) about the driving forces, barriers, and role of
   stakeholders in the implementation of digital transformations. The
   authors found that some technologies are implemented much more
   frequently compared to others, with some indication for country
   specialization. The leading driving force is customer satisfaction
   followed by productivity and financial motives. Shortage of skilled
   human resources and high implementation costs are the main barriers. The
   firms tend to rely on universities and research centers, while the
   government is perceived only as a financial provider. The results are
   also informative for practitioners and policymakers-providing them with

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to propose a collaborative approach model
   developed based on observations of two aerospace manufacturing small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) pursuing their digital transformation
   toward Industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach This research focuses
   on two manufacturing SMEs in North America, and data were collected
   using longitudinal case study and research intervention method. Data
   collection was performed through observation and intervention within the
   collaborative projects over 18 months. Findings A model of a
   collaborative approach to digital transformation (CADT) for
   manufacturing SMEs was produced. Based on the study findings, the
   collaboration manifests itself at various stages of the transformation
   projects, such as the business needs alignment, project portfolio
   creation, technology solution selection and post-mortem phase. Research
   limitations/implications Research using the case study method has a
   limitation in the generalization of the model. The CADT model generated
   in this study might be specific to the aerospace manufacturing industry
   and collaboration patterns between manufacturing SMEs. The results could
   vary in different contexts. Practical implications The proposed CADT
   model is particularly relevant for manufacturing SMEs' managers and
   consultants working on digital transformation projects. By adopting this
   approach, they could better plan and guide their collaboration approach
   during their Industry 4.0 transformation. Originality/value This
   research provides a new perspective to digital transformation approaches
   in the aerospace industry. It can be integrated into other research
   findings to formulate a more integrated and comprehensive CADT model in
   industries where SMEs are significant players.},

	abstract = {The digital transformation (DT) is reshaping the economy and society. In
   supply chains (SCs), DT involves adopting digital technologies to
   collaborate. DT opportunities are particularly diverse in globally
   distributed manufacturing networks (GDMN) and SCs. Here, DT influences
   both internal and external collaboration activ-ities, i.e.,
   configuration and coordination of the intra-firm network and network
   relationships, structure, and governance in the inter-firm network. This
   study investigates if and how DT changes relationship dynamics and
   collaboration efficiency in SCs and distributed manufacturing networks
   through information sharing and jointly used digital technologies. While
   existing studies have mainly focused on individual digital technologies
   and their potential for SCs and manufacturing networks, this study
   contributes to a better understanding of the adoption process and the
   change in relationship dynamics through DT and joint use of digital
   technologies. The meth-odology follows a qualitative approach in a
   multi-case study setting with six multi-national manufacturing companies
   operating extensive intra-firm and inter-firm networks. A theoretical
   framework based on organisa-tional information processing theory guides
   the study. Data is collected in semi-structured interviews and enriched
   by secondary data from internal company documents and publicly available
   sources. The results indicate that digital tools are triggering a
   centralisation trend in intra-firm networks that leverages efficiencies
   but is met with stakeholder scepticism. SC collaboration is becoming
   increasingly dynamic through digital tools, which the SC partners often
   promote. Non-adopters are not being dropped yet, but the pressure of
   digital transformation is increasing and becoming more of a threat to
   small businesses.},

	abstract = {The Additive Manufacturing (AM) industry is of paramount importance as
   means of personalized design capabilities by rapid prototyping, using
   exact amount of required materials avoiding waste, and applying Industry
   4.0 technologies with digital transformation ability. The
   characteristics of AM are regarded as the prerequisites for
   sustainability in the manufacturing industry. However, there are limited
   papers discussing the stakeholders and sustainability objectives in a
   single comprehensive analysis. Hence, the purpose of this research is to
   identify the degree of each stakeholder to achieve the objective of
   sustainability in AM supply chain by proposing a novel Plithogenic Fuzzy
   MACTOR approach. Results reveal that the customers are in triggering
   position to shape entire AM supply chain as the demand generators.
   Workforce is a significant player in the AM supply chain by creating the
   design, manufacturing, marketing, and communicating to provide the
   collaborations in this business segment. Academia positions here a
   supportive role to enable the whole supply chain members in terms of
   delivering technological advancements, training people, and providing
   the workforce. The AM manufacturers and material / software / printer
   suppliers are the key players leading to the supply chain by producing
   the main business products. Thus, a practitioner can interpret its
   position in the AM supply chain and understand the requirements of
   sustainability points in detail. Besides, this study provides a
   theoretical contribution to the literature by extending the MACTOR
   analysis with Plithogenic sets via including a different uncertainty
   measure.},

	abstract = {In today's digital age, many managers need to find new ways to manage
   collaborations where complementary partners co-create digital solutions.
   Collaborations with partners are at the center of digital projects, but
   managing these collaborations is challenging. This article objective is
   to investigate how research and development collaborations with
   scientific and business partners contribute to digital transformation.
   This has been achieved through an empirical investigation of three
   Brazilian manufacturers that are already on their journey toward
   digitalization. The research design involves multiple case studies and
   qualitative analysis, through data collection by interviews and
   questionnaires with participants from the tactical and strategic level
   followed by content analysis as well as nonparticipant observations. The
   findings indicate that the companies are at the early stage of building
   a digital ecosystem. However, they have already secured benefits from
   pursuing open innovation practices in the form of competitive advantage
   in operational processes. The results indicate that business success
   depends more on how (disruptive) technologies are developed and used by
   engaged people to add value to the enterprise, rather than simply
   adopting new technologies by themselves. Manufacturers need to act now
   to reshape their mindset, operational processes, and business models,
   respectively, enabling the understanding that: 1) organizational
   ecosystems are becoming more open and collaborative; 2) the value of
   data capture and analysis can be developed and used for data-driven
   learning, preventive and predictive capabilities, supporting
   decision-making; 3) customers' preferences need to be internalized to
   deliver customized experiences.},

	abstract = {Purpose - Inter-organisational governance is an important enabler for
   information processing, particularly in relationships undergoing digital
   transformation (DT) where partners depend on each other for information
   in decision-making. Based on information processing theory (IPT), the
   authors theoretically and empirically investigate how governance
   mechanisms address information asymmetry (uncertainty and equivocality)
   arising in capturing, sharing and interpreting information generated by
   digital technologies.
   Design/methodology/approach - IPT is applied to four cases of
   public-private relationships in the Dutch infrastructure sector that aim
   to enhance the quantity and quality of information-based decision-making
   by implementing digital technologies. The investigated relationships are
   characterised by differing degrees and types of information uncertainty
   and equivocality. The authors build on rich data sets including archival
   data, observations, contract documents and interviews.
   Findings - Addressing information uncertainty requires invoking
   contractual control and coordination. Contract clauses should be precise
   and incentive schemes functional in terms of information requirements.
   Information equivocality is best addressed by using relational
   governance. Identifying information requirements and reducing
   information uncertainty are a prerequisite for the transformation
   activities that organisations perform to reduce information
   equivocality.
   Originality/value - This study draws on IPT to study public-private
   relationships undergoing DT. The study links contractual control and
   coordination as well as relational governance mechanisms to
   informationprocessing activities that organisations deploy to reduce
   information uncertainty and equivocality.},

@article{WOS:000761451900014,
	abstract = {Background The Global Digital Exemplar (GDE) Programme is a national
   initiative to promote digitally enabled transformation in English
   provider organizations. The Programme applied benefits realization
   management techniques to promote and demonstrate transformative
   outcomes. This work was part of an independent national evaluation of
   the GDE Programme. Aims We explored how benefits realization management
   was approached and conceptualized in the GDE Programme. Methods We
   conducted a series of 36 longitudinal case studies of provider
   organizations participating in the GDE Programme, 12 of which were in
   depth. Data collection included a combination of 628 interviews (with
   implementation staff in provider organizations, national programme
   management staff, and suppliers), 499 documents (of national and local
   implementation plans and lessons learned), and 190 nonparticipant
   observations (of national and local programme management meetings to
   develop insights into the broader context of benefits realization
   activities, tensions arising, and how these were negotiated). Data were
   coded drawing on a sociotechnical framework developed in related work
   and thematically analyzed, initially within and then across cases, with
   the help of NVivo 11 software. Results Most stakeholders broadly agreed
   with the rationale of benefits realization in the GDE Programme to show
   due diligence that public money was appropriately spent, and to develop
   an evidence base supporting the value of digitally enabled
   transformation. Differing national and local reporting purposes,
   however, created tensions. Central requirements, for progress reporting
   and tracking high-level benefits, had limited perceived local value and
   were seen to impose an unnecessary burden on provider organizations.
   This was accentuated by the lack of harmonization of reporting
   requirements to different stakeholders (which differed in content and
   timing). There were tensions between the desire for early evidence of
   outcomes and the slow processes of infrastructural change (which created
   problems of attribution of benefits to causes as benefits emerged
   gradually and over long timeframes), and also between reporting
   immediately visible local changes and showing how these flowed through
   to high level organization wide benefits (eg, in terms of health
   outcomes or cost savings/return on investment). The attempt to fulfill
   these diverging agendas and informational needs within a single
   reporting tool had limited success. These difficulties were mitigated by
   efforts to simplify reporting requirements and to support targeted
   collection of key national outcome measures. Although progress was
   hampered by an initial lack of benefits realization expertise in
   provider organizations, some providers subsequently retained these
   skills for their own change management purposes. Conclusions There is a
   need to recognize the limitations and cost of benefits realization
   management practices in the context of healthcare digitalization where
   benefits may materialize over long timeframes and in unanticipated ways.
   Although diverse stakeholder information needs may create tensions,
   prior agreement about rationales for collecting information and a
   targeted approach to tracking local and high-level benefits may enhance
   local relevance, reduce perceived reporting burdens, and improve
   acceptance/effectiveness. A single integrated reporting mechanism is
   unlikely to fulfill both national and local requirements.},

	abstract = {Purpose Digitalization is the great global challenge of the twenty-first
   century including technologies, like, Internet-of-Things, Big Data and
   block-chain. New digital innovation can play a crucial role for the
   competitiveness and sustainability of agro-food small and medium-size
   enterprises (SMEs) but in Europe it has been adopted by only 25\% of
   farmers. Joined participation in EU R\&D projects can boost SME's
   digital innovation. The paper aims to analyze how business networking,
   within a R\&D project, affects the digital innovation of agro-food SMEs.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper investigates a single longitudinal
   case study focused on the local development phase of the EU Horizon 2020
   project ``Eugenius{''}, which aims to develop a European business
   network able to provide Earth observation services for natural resources
   management in agriculture. The focus is on the dyadic relationship
   between two firms, the winery Tormaresca and the digital innovation
   provider Planetek. Findings Results highlight that the process of
   commercialization of Planetek's innovative services significantly passes
   through a multifaceted process of development and adaptation of
   technology to the specific needs of the user company, allowed by the
   research project with no expense for both companies during the
   experimentation phase. Originality/value The paper deals with a new
   underexplored topic thus giving interesting insights into how the R\&D
   project participation affects agro-food SMEs in adopting digital
   innovations, which are difficult to acquire directly, and how this
   influences the value creation process and their organizational

	abstract = {There is focus among most leading academic institutions globally to
   understand digital transformation. While most operate on some common
   premise related with the construct of digital transformation there is no
   established definition yet. Existing descriptions cover a wide range of
   things from smart living, future of work, automation, industry
   convergence, and technology among others. These are sometimes fairly all
   encompassing, inconsistent and incomparable as a point of reference.
   Interestingly, major consulting firms, technology promoters, independent
   influencers, analysts promote transformation solutions, each with their
   own models, interpretation and descriptions.
   In the paper, we develop an understanding on what is the nature of
   demand for digital transformation. This is based on evidences of
   narratives from large financial institutions. We scoped our study on
   four large banks in North America to see - is there an essence of
   transformation when institutions adopt digital technology? The paper
   deals on key themes - drivers, benefits, perception of digital
   transformation, readiness of banks and deployment instances.
   Understanding how large financial institutions are adopting digital
   technologies is important for contemporary technology providers,
   institutions, researchers and analysts.
   The study conducted is qualitative along with associated quantitative
   techniques and visual analytics. This is achieved by theme-based
   narrative analysis of the public disclosures from four large North
   American Banks across five years (FY'13-FY'17). The research analyzes
   the relevant narratives from annual reports to code them into logical
   themes thereby providing a view of the key focus and associations.
   Analyzing the practices and manifestations of the institutions this
   research classifies standard and more advanced differentiating
   practices. This leads to an emergent structure for a Digital
   Transformation Maturity Model (DTMM). The authors believe these will
   serve as indicative maturity guidance for digital technology adoption by
   financial institutions, in similar context and will also be beneficial
   to technology providers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to the barriers of finance, talent, and technology, small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have faced uncertainty and risks if they
   fail to engage in digital transformation (DT). A good choice is for SMEs
   to choose solutions already on the market, provided by professional DT
   solutions suppliers. However, how to choose the most suitable DT
   solution remains a major challenge for SMEs. Thus, to help SMEs to
   select an appropriate DT solution, we proposed a novel, prospect
   theory-based evidential reasoning (ER) assessment method under a
   hesitant picture fuzzy linguistic sets (HPFLSs) environment. First, the
   novel distance measures of picture fuzzy sets (PFSs) and HPFLSs are
   proposed, then, based on the proposed distance measures of HPFLSs,
   novel, prospect theory formula are constructed. Additionally, a novel
   HPFLS ER method was developed to aggregate the evaluation information.
   Afterward, an assessment and selection decision approach for DT
   solutions for SMEs, based on the prospect theory-based ER of HPFLSs, was
   conducted. Finally, actual examples of DT solutions for SMEs to
   illustrate the decision-making approach were used to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, and the conclusions were

@article{WOS:000460662000003,
	abstract = {Objectives: This article discusses the technology and business
   transformation of electronically collecting, documenting, and sharing
   pharmacists' clinical services. The article discusses the current
   landscape of pharmacy management systems as it pertains to pharmacy
   practice and to identify opportunities, benefits, and challenges for
   pharmacists as providers.
   Summary: Pharmacists providing clinical services are in the midst of
   transforming the practice of pharmacy. From a technology standpoint,
   pharmacy operations must digitally transform their practices to keep up
   with the rest of health care. Today's pharmacies do a great job of
   electronically standardizing the prescription dispensing and billing
   processes; we need to rethink how to document clinical services in a way
   that makes sense to pharmacists. Digitally transforming pharmacy
   clinical workflow to fully integrate pharmacist-provided clinical data
   using nationally recognized standards is not an easy task for pharmacy
   system vendors. Pharmacy management systems are based on
   prescription-dispensing process or propriety clinical documentation
   functions designed to meet customers' or payers' needs. The government
   and quality-setting organizations play an important role driving digital
   transformation.
   Conclusion: The Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners (JCPP)
   Pharmacists' Patient Care Process standardized the pharmacists' clinical
   workflow steps, and it is used as the cornerstone for standardizing
   pharmacists' electronic clinical workflow within pharmacy systems. Since
   its founding in 2010, Pharmacy Health Information Technology
   Collaborative (PHIT) members understood the need to digitally transform
   pharmacy management systems from prescription focus and build awareness
   of standardizing pharmacist-provided clinical services and outcomes
   through the use of the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicined-Clinical
   Terms and the Pharmacist eCare Plan. The technology is now available for
   sharing clinical data. Pharmacists and pharmacy operations will need to
   transform their business models by adopting technology standards
   outlined in this article to keep up with the rest of the health care
   industry. (C) 2019 American Pharmacists Association (R). Published by

	abstract = {Manufacturers are exploring the extent to which digital technology
   applications can support their sustainability efforts by helping to
   convert abstract sustainability goals, such as those of net-zero
   emissions and circular economy (CE), into feasible and practical
   actions, achievements, and ultimately, a sustainable competitive edge.
   This work adopts a resource-based view (RBV) to explore the potential
   role that digital technologies play in the cultivation of a
   manufacturing firm's competitive advantage, and the deployment of
   existing internal resources and core competencies to achieve net-zero
   manufacturing emissions and CE. Two questions are addressed: (1) What
   competitive advantage(s) may be derived from the integration of digital
   technologies to achieve net-zero manufacturing emissions, and (2) does
   adopting an RBV facilitate the development of meaningful (and novel)
   competitive advantage? Engaged scholarship is used to analyse and apply
   theory to an empirical, real-world dataset documenting the perspectives
   and experiences of 13 manufacturing firms. Applying the VRIO framework,
   21 identified digital technology-based core competencies are categorised
   as forms of competitive advantage that may be possible for manufacturing
   firms pursuing net-zero emissions. Four scenarios of digital technology
   adoption pathways are proposed, differentiated by the degree of radical
   vs. incremental interests and options available to the firm. This study
   highlights the critical need for firms to incorporate intangible asset
   management and development, including the labour and supply chain
   relationships, as part of their digital transformation strategies.
   Further, we demonstrate the potential of RBV as a lens for evaluating
   the competitive advantage potential of corporate sustainability
   initiatives, and facilitating the development of related strategies.},

	abstract = {The promotion of the simultaneous advancement of digitalization and
   sustainability has emerged as a crucial concern for achieving
   high-quality economic growth within the framework of the `dual-carbon'
   objective. Based on the micro data of Chinese A-share listed companies
   between 2009 and 2022, this paper systematically examines how digital
   transformation affects the ESG performance of enterprises in order to
   explore the effective path for digitalization to promote the sustainable
   development of enterprises. The results indicate that implementing
   digital transformation can enhance the ESG performance of enterprises,
   which in turn boosts their capacity for sustainable development. The
   test of the mechanism indicates that enhancing internal total factor
   productivity and optimizing external financial allocation efficiency are
   the key strategies for driving ESG performance improvement in companies
   through digital transformation. Further analysis reveals that the
   improvement effect of digital transformation on corporate ESG
   performance is more prominent in state-owned enterprises, non-heavily
   polluted industries, central and western, and low-marketization regions.
   In addition, while digital transformation enhances the ESG performance
   of enterprises themselves, it also creates beneficial ripple effects on
   the ESG metrics of their suppliers and customers, ultimately boosting
   the sustainable growth of the entire supply chain. The conclusions of
   this paper help to deepen the potential value of digital transformation
   and provide policy and practical insights for achieving sustainable
   economic development.},

	abstract = {Drawing on interviews with ten Hungarian digital automotive technology
   providers, this paper investigates how digital transformation can assist
   factory economy digital entrepreneurs in their integration in the highly
   concentrated automotive global value chains (GVCs). We identified four
   mechanisms by which digital transformation can, in principle, produce
   opportunities for factory economies in progressing towards economy
   actors' entrepreneurial integration in automotive GVCs, as follows. (1)
   New entrepreneurial opportunities in the digital realm; (2) Fine-slicing
   innovation and globalisation of R \& D; (3) Ecosystem-type innovation
   collaboration; (4) Interaction-intensity of custom-tailored digital
   services provision. However, to realise the potential of these
   opportunities, a critical mass of capable digital entrepreneurs needs to
   be achieved: a long way to go for factory economies.},

   technologies to help deliver conservation objectives. This has led to
   collaborative forms of working with academia to spearhead digital
   innovation. Through in-depth interviews with three UK
   research-council-funded case studies, we show that by working with
   academics conservation organisations can receive positive and negative
   impacts, some of which cut across their operations. Positive impacts
   include new ways of engaging with audiences, improved data workflows,
   financial benefits, capacity building and the necessary digital
   infrastructure to help them influence policy. Negative impacts include
   the time and resources required to learn new skills and sustain new
   technologies, managing different organisational objectives and shifts in
   working practices as a result of the new technologies. Most importantly,
   collaboration with academics was shown to bring the opportunity of a
   profound change in perspectives on technologies with benefits to the

	abstract = {Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has, besides the health concerns, caused
   an unprecedented social and economic crisis that has particularly hit
   service industries hard. Due to extensive safety measures, many service
   employees have to work remotely to keep service businesses running. With
   limited literature on leadership and virtual work in the service
   context, this paper aims to report on leadership effectiveness regarding
   employees' work performance in virtual settings brought on by the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the
   input-process-outcome (IPO) framework, this research investigates the
   effectiveness of leadership on service employees' work performance
   mediated by work-related tension, autonomy, and group cohesiveness.
   Furthermore, this study explores moderating effects of the service
   provider's digital maturity. To test the derived model, the authors
   collected survey data from 206 service employees who, due to the
   COVID-19 pandemic, unexpectedly had to transform to a virtual work
   environment. The authors analyzed the data using partial least squares
   structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings The results indicated
   that it took task- and relation-oriented leadership behavior to maintain
   service employees' work performance in a virtual environment during
   crisis situations. Further, results indicated mediating effects of
   service employees' individual job autonomy and team cohesiveness;
   surprisingly, work-related tension did not impact employees' work
   performance. Results offered service businesses guidance on how to
   effectively lead in times of crisis when service employees predominantly
   work in virtual environments. Originality/value This is the first
   empirical study to show how leadership affects service employees' work
   performance in a virtual work environment during crisis times. Thus, the
   study contributes to the scarce literature on the impact of leadership
   in service firms that have to operate in such a setting.},

	abstract = {Digitization has been a central pillar of structural investments to
   promote organizational capacity for transformation, and yet skilled
   nursing facilities (SNFs) and other post-acute providers have been
   excluded and/or delayed in benefitting from the past decade of
   substantial public and private-sector investment in information
   technology (IT). These settings have limited internal capacity and
   resources to invest in digital capabilities on their own, propagating a
   limited infrastructure that may only further sideline SNFs and their
   role in an ever-evolving health care landscape that needs to be focused
   on age-friendly, high-value care. Meaningful progress will require
   continuous refinement of supportive policy, financial investment, and
   scalable organizational best practices specific to the SNF context. In
   this essay, we lay out an action agenda to move from age-agnostic to
   age-friendly digital transformation. Key to the value proposition of
   these efforts is a focus on interoperability-the seamless exchange of
   electronic health information across settings that is critical for care
   coordination and for providers to have the information they need to make
   safe and appropriate care decisions. Interoperability is not synonymous
   with digital transformation, but a foundational building block for its
   potential. We characterize the current state of digitization in SNFs in
   the context of key health IT policy advancements over the past decade,
   identifying ongoing and emergent policy work where the digitization
   needs of SNFs and other post-acute settings can be better addressed. We
   also discuss accompanying implementation considerations and strategies
   for optimally translating policy efforts into impactful practice change
   across an ever-evolving post-acute landscape. Acting on these insights
   at the policy and practice level provides cautious optimism that nursing
   home care-and care for older adults across the care continuum-may
   benefit more equitably from the promise of future digitization.},

	abstract = {This article focuses on the transformation and development of
   traditional industries in the context of digital economy. The
   Hamilton-Jacobi-Berman equation is used to investigate the coordination
   mechanism and optimal strategy of industrial integration from a
   quantitative perspective and examine the dynamic decision-making
   processes among traditional enterprises, digital technology providers,
   and local governments by constructing a tripartite dynamic differential
   game model, and the degree of optimal effort, the optimal benefits, the
   level of industrial digitalization and the proportion of local
   government subsidies to enterprises are obtained in three cases: a Nash
   non-cooperative game, a Stackelberg game and a cooperative game. The
   results show that (1) the government subsidy coefficient, as an
   effective adjustment mechanism, can significantly improve the degree of
   optimal effort of traditional enterprises and digital technology
   providers, (2) the tripartite optimal strategy, optimal benefits, total
   system benefits and level of industrial digitization in the case of the
   cooperative game are strictly superior to those in non-cooperative
   situations, achieving the Pareto optimum of the system, (3) the results
   of the theoretical derivation are verified through the analysis of
   numerical simulation and case study. The study provides a theoretical
   basis and practical support for the digital transformation of
   traditional industries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose - Firms are driven to ride on the digital wave in today's open
   innovation ecosystem. This study aims to explore the effect of digital
   transformation (DT) on knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS)
   firms' innovation ambidexterity, namely, radical versus incremental
   innovation, respectively. Meanwhile, the authors evaluated the
   moderating role of the complexity of R\&D collaboration portfolio (i.e.
   organizational diversity and geographic diversity) in the above
   relationships.Design/methodology/approach - Using a panel data set of
   171 Chinese listed firms in the information and communications
   technology services industry from 2010 to 2018, the proposed hypotheses
   were empirically attested.Findings - It is found that DT has a positive
   relationship with radical innovation and an inverted U-shaped
   relationship with incremental innovation. In terms of the R\&D
   collaboration portfolio, organizational diversity positively moderates
   the relationships between DT and innovation ambidexterity, respectively.
   The geographic diversity weakens the inverted U-shaped effect of DT on
   incremental innovation; however, its moderating role in the link between
   DT and radical innovation is not empirically verified.Originality/value
   - Extant scholars mainly addressed the interplay between KIBS firms and
   their manufacturing clients, while this study reveals the different
   consequences of DT on KIBS firms' innovation ambidexterity to highlight
   the role of KIBS firms is an independent and essential innovator in a
   knowledge-driven economy. Notably, the findings contribute to knowledge
   management (KM) and R\&D literature by confirming the diversity of the
   R\&D collaboration portfolio is a critical KM strategy for KIBS firms to
   develop and promote external knowledge resources.},

	abstract = {We introduce a project titled as Our Shared Virtual World which aims at
   increasing public libraries' capability to provide knowledge on digital
   technology to general public. The practical goal of the project has been
   to produce a functional prototype of a virtual reality (VR) application
   that could be utilized freely in all the public libraries in Finland. In
   many countries worldwide, libraries' role is expanding from providers of
   traditional books to providers of information technologies and related
   new forms of literacy, and this development provides the broader
   backdrop for the project. The contribution of the article is two-fold:
   First, we describe how an immersive VR application can be
   collaboratively developed within this specific research context, namely
   within a network of public libraries, and introduce the tangible outcome
   of the project, the VR application called Forest Elf. Secondly, we
   scrutinize how results of such a design work can be sustained over time:
   through participatory design (PD), we aimed at creating conditions which
   would enable public libraries to continue developing and using the
   artefact also after the project. We provide insights on how to tackle
   the challenge of research prototypes ending up being abandoned, and what
   factors in the context of library partnership support or hamper
   sustainable digital innovation - digital innovation that is inclusive
   and equitable but also has a long-lasting impact. \& COPY; 2023 The

	abstract = {The housing emergency that follows natural disasters is generally dealt
   with ``temporary{''} prefabricated housing, usually designed for short
   and medium-term life cycle and often arranged in dormitory suburbs,
   mostly devoid of any basic facility. When the rebuilding processes takes
   time, as usually happens, those settlements end up causing a ``second
   emergency{''}, with dramatic repercussions on people's health and
   communities' cohesion.
   Facing this problem, some international experiences match digital
   technologies with lightweight building systems and local unskilled labor
   to produce innovative and temporary shelters. Among these studies, the
   works of Hiroto Kobayashi in the Far East and his ``veneer building
   system{''} are particularly significant.
   Italy is a seismic land where ``reconstruction{''} has always been a
   disputed process that forces people to live a long time in those kinds
   of settlements. A recent example is the 2016/17 Central-Italy
   earthquake. After four years, less than 5\% of the 80 thousand
   uninhabitable houses have been rebuilt or recovered. People are worried
   about an uncertain future.
   This paper presents the outcome of a design experience carried out, in
   partnership, with the Italian University of Camerino and the Japanese
   Keio University. Two innovative ``mobile{''} pavilions (for cultural
   activities) were built in Amandola, one of the Italian villages heavily
   damaged by the 2016/17 earthquake. The local student community was
   engaged; digital technologies were applied; the veneer system was
   experienced. This work represents an unusual application of digital
   technologies in the Central-Italy disaster area as well as an original
   implementation of the veneer system.},

	abstract = {Research SummaryThe question of why and how strategic leaders differ in
   the ecosystems they envision is central to firms' digital
   transformation. We unpack the cognitive microfoundations of how
   strategic leaders form their ecosystem vision-a mental model of a firm's
   multilateral complementarities with its partners to realize a value
   proposition. Our motivated interactional lens emphasizes the role of
   strategic leaders' cognitive motivation for shaping four interaction
   types with (prospective) partners: participatory, selective,
   collaborative, and reclusive. We theorize how these interactions shape
   the changes strategic leaders make in their mental models, and thus, to
   envision different levels and types of complementarities with
   (prospective) partners in the digital transformation. Our theory
   illuminates the roles of strategic leaders, their cognitive motivations,
   and social interactions in firms' ecosystem leadership.Managerial
   SummaryDigital transformation is an ecosystem challenge for incumbent
   firms. As part of their ecosystem leadership, strategic leaders need to
   form a vision of how to complement their value offerings with
   (prospective) partners' offerings. This vision, in turn, can affect the
   types of ecosystems they enact. We develop a theoretical model that
   emphasizes the role of strategic leaders' cognitive motivation for the
   interactions they engage in with (prospective) partners and for the
   types of ecosystem visions they form as a result.},

	abstract = {Education is the most important part of sustainable society development.
   Traditional approaches to permanent lifelong educator training often
   fail to produce lasting changes in teaching practices (UN, Goal 4). This
   paper examines how educator involvement in a professional learning
   community (PLC) ensures equitable quality education and promotes
   lifelong learning opportunities for all and a sustainable digital
   transformation of the teaching and learning process. Participation in
   PLC and the use of contemporary learning environments positively impact
   the quality of educators' work, thereby enhancing the overall
   educational process. This study utilised a quantitative methodology,
   employing both descriptive and inferential statistics to analyse the
   data. Results indicate that a balanced integration of formal PLC
   structures and guidance, combined with elements of a non-formal, broader
   PLC and external incentives and support (such as projects), can surpass
   mere exchanges of best practices, foster innovation, and support the
   sustainable digital transformation of educators. This approach leads to
   a sustainable shift in pedagogical paradigms. The PLC\_IP model (focused
   on including digital technologies and effective teaching strategies)
   enhances collective educator efficacy, contributing to improved teaching
   quality. For PLCs to achieve sustainability, they must be dynamic
   entities that adapt to the evolving educational landscape, ensuring
   their continued relevance and impact with rising completion rates over
   time. Our findings underscore the importance of innovative PLCs in
   driving sustainable educational development and improvement and provide
   a framework for future research and practical applications in
   educational settings. In addition, PLCs can strengthen the means of
   implementation and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable
   development (UN, Goal 17).},

	abstract = {Digital management system is widely used in the business activities of
   enterprises. Practice has proved that the implementation of the
   manufacturing execution system (MES) can better monitor and manage the
   production process, improve the production efficiency of enterprises,
   and effectively realize zero defect management (ZDM). Against this
   background, the influencing factors of implementing MES in ZDM
   enterprises in digital transformation were obtained by using the
   literature extraction-Delphi method, and the relationship between the
   factors was analyzed by using the system dynamics simulation model in
   this study. It is found that different from the existing research works
   on the implementation of MES in enterprises, staff preparation and level
   of information sharing are the most influential factors and play an
   important role in the implementation of MES in ZDM enterprises.
   Equipment preparation and client preparation followed closely, with
   supplier implementation team and scale infrastructure conditions playing
   a key role in providing capability support. This finding provides the
   direction for enterprises to improve the relevant implementation
   measures in time to ensure the effective implementation of MES in ZDM
   enterprises, and also provides a breakthrough for relevant researchers

	abstract = {The organization of open data hackathons or digital innovation
   competitions is a significant opportunity for nascent entrepreneurs to
   collaborate with external partners, promote new ideas and extend their
   applications to a new start-up. Prior studies have not thoroughly
   compared the execution of different strategies in many hackathons or
   digital innovation competitions. They only focus on the actions that the
   organizers of a specific hackathon have implemented or the challenges
   they have faced. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine goals and
   design strategies that contribute to the successful execution of open
   data hackathons and innovation competitions. Six case studies of open
   data hackathons and innovation competitions held between 2014 and 2018
   in Thessaloniki have been explored to understand the co-ordination
   between the multiple stakeholders of these events and improve the
   execution of open data hackathons and innovation competitions. The
   outcomes indicate that the most critical design strategy was the
   involvement of mentors in the event and the level of support provided to
   nascent entrepreneurs to accelerate their creativity, develop
   applications and launch their prototypes on the market.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to characterize the interfaces
   between manufacturing companies and the Internet of Things (IoT)
   suppliers involved in their digital servitization.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper builds on an explorative case
   study of a manufacturing firm and its IoT suppliers. This paper relies
   on the Industrial Network Approach to study interfaces between buying
   firms and their suppliers. Findings This paper identifies three distinct
   types of supplier interfaces: connected, digital and digital-physical.
   They all contain technical resource interfaces with additional
   organizational and/or technical complexities that need to be managed.
   Connectivity, an Agile approach to software development and strong
   technical dependence emerged as key factors that impact the interactions
   between manufacturing firms and IoT suppliers and how their resources
   are combined. Practical implications This paper offers managerial
   implications regarding the importance of internal organization (such as
   appropriate cross-functional teams) to manage the dynamics of
   collaborations required by digital technologies, maintain interactions
   with IoT suppliers and identify and manage interdependences between IoT
   suppliers. Building close relationships with suppliers of crucial
   infrastructure (e.g. IoT cloud platform and data security systems) can
   also be beneficial for manufacturing firms to reduce risks. Finally,
   attention should be given to IoT technology strategy, which impacts both
   digital and digital-physical supplier interfaces. Originality/value In
   digital servitization, manufacturing firms are heavily reliant on
   external resources for IoT technology. Despite this, few studies have
   investigated the characteristics of their interfaces with IoT suppliers,
   how these can be managed and how resources are combined.},

	abstract = {Boundary resources have been shown to enable the arm's-length
   relationships between platform owners and third-party developers that
   underlie digital innovation in platform ecosystems. While boundary
   resources that are owned by opensource communities and small-scale
   software vendors are also critical components in the digital
   infrastructure, their role in digital innovation has yet to be
   systematically explored. In particular, software libraries are popular
   boundary resources that provide functionality without the need for
   continued interaction with their owners. They are used extensively by
   commercial vendors to enable customization of their software products,
   by communities to disseminate open-source software, and by big-tech
   platform owners to provide functionality that does not involve control.
   This article reports on the deployment of such software libraries in the
   web and mobile (Android) contexts by 107 start-up companies in London.
   Our findings show that libraries owned by big-tech companies, product
   vendors, and communities coexist; that the deployment of big-tech
   libraries is unaffected by the scale of the deploying start-up; and that
   context evolution paths are consequential for library deployment. These
   findings portray a balanced picture of digital infrastructure as neither
   the community-based utopia of early open-source research nor the
   dystopia of the recent digital dominance literature.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation and sustainability transformation are at the top
   of organizations' agendas to remain competitive. While guidance on both
   transformations exists separately, even more research on integrating
   digital and sustainability transformation, namely twin transformation,
   is required. Specifically, deeper knowledge about relevant twin
   transformation capabilities and progress is needed for effective
   implementation. To enhance the understanding and provide corresponding
   guidance, we developed a twin transformation capability maturity model
   focusing on dynamic capabilities required to realize twin transformation
   based on a structured literature review and interviews with 13 experts.
   Further, we demonstrated its use with a technology service provider. Our
   contribution is twofold: First, accounting for organizations' twin
   transformation starting points in terms of their digitalization and
   sustainability experience and expertise, we reveal three pathways to
   becoming a twin transformer. Second, our work provides an overview of 45
   relevant twin transformation capabilities structured along six
   capability dimensions and four maturity stages. Our work also provides
   relevant practical implications supporting organizations in assessing
   their twin transformation maturity building the foundation for targeted

	abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to explore the interrelationship
   between digital transformation of life cycle assessment (LCA) and
   operational excellence. Adopting the socio-technical systems theory and
   the resource-based view, the study examines the mediating role of big
   data analytics capability at the individual level and the moderating
   role of data-driven culture at the organizational level in that
   relationship.MethodsA quantitative methodology was adopted using
   structural equation modeling (SEM). Data were collected through an
   online survey administered to 300 Italian agri-food firms identified
   through the AIDA database. Two hundred twenty-nine valid responses were
   gathered from such firms adopting LCA, resulting in a usable response
   rate of 76\%. Data analysis was performed initially through a
   confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the psychometric properties of
   the measurement model and then through a path analysis to test the
   study's hypothesis in the structural model.ResultsThe results indicate
   that the digital transformation of LCA does not significantly impact
   operational excellence directly. Instead, this relationship was fully
   mediated by big data analytics capability, which highlights the
   important role of human resources in nurturing this capability in the
   process of digital transformation of LCA. More importantly, the findings
   highlight the need to foster a data-driven culture, given its
   significantly positive moderating effect on the relationship between the
   digital transformation of LCA and big data analytics
   capability.ConclusionsThe study provides an important perspective of
   LCA, showing that the digital transformation of LCA is a unified and
   dynamic process. The study also highlights the importance of human
   resource management in nurturing big data analytics capability at the
   individual level and intangible resource management of a data-driven
   culture at the organizational level in the success of digital
   transformation of LCA in achieving operational excellence.},

   Digitization has influenced various sectors of the Korean music industry
   such as business, society, and consumers. It has also transformed the
   management focus of the industry from analog to digital, from offline to
   online, from albums to songs, from specialization to integration, from
   domestic providers to international suppliers, from audio sound to
   visual images, from possessing to accessing, and from limited
   integration to synergistic network. This signifies that embracing
   technology advancement can enhance the competitiveness of cultural
   industries.},

	abstract = {This study provides evidence for the supply network position influencing
   innovation performance and the moderating effect of digital
   transformation. Supply chain relationships have been evaluated in
   earlier research to demonstrate how concentrations of customers and
   suppliers may either favorably or adversely impact innovation. These
   metrics, however, only take into account how closely a firm is connected
   to its direct customers or suppliers. This study integrates the top five
   suppliers and customers of Chinese listed manufacturing firms and
   considers the relationship embeddedness of each firm's direct customers
   and suppliers, as well as the structure embeddedness among the
   customers' customers, customers' suppliers, suppliers' customers, and
   suppliers' suppliers to reveal the true impact of supply chain
   relationships on innovation performance. The top five suppliers and
   consumers of each firm are chosen to build a supply network for each
   year using panel data of listed Chinese manufacturing firms from 2013 to
   2020. Social network analysis is used to determine network centrality
   and structural holes. The results show that in the supply network,
   network centrality and structural holes are significantly negatively
   correlated with innovation performance, especially in small and
   medium-sized firms, non-state-owned firms, and firms in recession phase.
   According to the moderating effect model, digital transformation is an
   efficient way to reduce the negative effect of supply network position
   on innovation performance. The research results will further improve the
   supply network cooperation mechanism, which is of great significance for
   improving supply chain resilience and firms' innovation.},

	abstract = {In Liquid Love Zygmunt Bauman argued that the solidity and security once
   provided by life-long partnerships has been liquefied' by rampant
   individualisation and technological change. He believes internet dating
   is symptomatic of social and technological change that transforms modern
   courtship into a type of commodified game. This article explores the
   experiences of users of digital dating and hook-up applications (or
   apps') in order to assess the extent to which a digital transformation
   of intimacy might be under way. It examines the different affordances
   provided by dating apps, and whether users feel the technology has
   influenced their sexual practices and views on long-term relationships,
   monogamy and other romantic ideals. This study shows that dating apps
   are intermediaries through which individuals engage in strategic
   performances in pursuit of love, sex and intimacy. Ultimately, this
   article contends that some accounts of dating apps and modern romantic
   practices are too pessimistic, and downplay the positives of networked
   intimacy'.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had two main consequences for the organization
   of treatment in primary healthcare: restricted patients' access to
   medical facilities and limited social mobility. In turn, these
   consequences pose a great challenge for patients and healthcare
   providers, i.e., the limited personal contact with medical
   professionals. This can be eased by new digital technology. While
   providing solutions to many problems, this technology poses several
   organizational challenges for healthcare system participants. As the
   current global situation and the outbreak of the humanitarian crisis in
   Europe show, these and other likely emergencies amplify the need to
   learn the lessons and prepare organizations for exceptional rapid
   changes. Therefore, a question arises of whether organizations are ready
   to use modern e-health solutions in the context of a rapidly and
   radically changing situation, and how this readiness can be verified.
   The aim of this article is to clarify the organizational e-heath
   readiness concept of Polish primary healthcare units. This study employs
   the triangulation of analytical methods, as it uses: (i) a literature
   review of e-health readiness assessment, (ii) primary data obtained with
   a survey (random sampling of 371 managers of PHC facilities across
   Poland) and (iii) the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling
   (PLS-SEM) method, employed to estimate the structural model. The
   evaluation of the model revealed that its concept was adequate for more
   mature entities that focus on the patient- and employee-oriented purpose
   of digitization, and on assuring excellent experience derived from a
   consistent care process. In the context of patients' restricted access
   to medical facilities and limited social mobility, a simpler version of
   the research model assesses the readiness more adequately. Finally, the
   study increases the knowledge base of assets (resources and
   capabilities), which will help healthcare systems better understand the
   challenges surrounding the adoption and scaling of e-health
   technologies.},

   Organisational readiness is found to have a direct effect on digital
   change. Organisational readiness also has a direct effect on innovation,

   Transformation of SCs, the research employs a multi-respondent survey on
   a sample of 101 Italian automotive suppliers. It analyses the interplay
   between investments in network and physical-digital interface
   technologies and buyer-supplier relationship governance models in a
   joint product development effort. The related effects on costs, from the
   automotive suppliers' perspective, are considered.
   Findings - The results confirm the TCE assumptions on governance
   mechanisms being appropriate to enhance cost performance, but in
   particular show that digital technologies shape the governance of
   buyersupplier relationships with different patterns. The features of
   synchronisation and accessibility, as ensured by network technologies,
   are found to strengthen the impact of contractual governance, while the
   adoption of physical-digital interface technologies, and their enhanced
   features of virtualisation and traceability, further enhance the impact
   of relational governance on the efficiency improvements of suppliers.
   Originality/value - This study is one of the first to have considered
   Digital Transformation in SCs from the suppliers' perspective and its
   implications on the efficiency of relationship governance with buyers.},

	abstract = {Purpose Previous research has highlighted the digitization of innovation
   processes and outcomes especially with regard to the impact of
   information technology (IT) on new product development (NPD). Instead of
   analyzing generic IT usage in the NPD, the purpose of this paper is to
   explore the influencing factors on the adoption of specific software
   tools to support innovation management methods, called innovation
   management software (IMS) and their specific functionality.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors used an online questionnaire and
   gathered data from 99 innovation managers of German industrial firms to
   explore which functionalities embedded in the tools such as aided
   innovation methods and activities influence the adoption of IMS.
   Findings This study's results indicate in contrast to the previous
   assumptions in the literature that the likelihood of IMS adoption by
   innovation managers is positively influenced if the IMS tools offer
   support functionality for idea evaluation and portfolio management but
   decreased for idea generation and scenario management. Therefore, this
   paper can show, that the digitalization of the innovation process though
   IT tools is more finely nuanced than a ``the more - the better{''} logic
   often promoted in the digitalization context and proposed in the
   literature on IMS before. Originality/value These findings advance the
   understanding of technological and organizational drivers of the
   transformation toward the digitalization of the innovation process from
   the perspective of innovation managers, who intend to do so by
   successfully introducing and using IMS in their NPD. Additionally,
   suppliers of IMS get valuable empirical-based indications from the user
   perspective that potentially supports their development and sales
   activities. From a theoretical perspective, this study extends prior
   research on IT usage and digitalization in the innovation process by
   expanding to an under-researched category of digitization for the
   innovation manager perspective aspects of the NPD activities.},

@article{WOS:000719304200008,
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Innovation based on information and communication technology
   (ICT) plays an increasingly important role in agricultural
   research-for-development efforts. It has been recognized, however, that
   the weak adoption and low impact of many ICT-for-agriculture (ICT4Ag)
   efforts are partly due to poor design. Often, design was driven more by
   technological feasibility than by a thorough analysis of the target
   group's needs and capacities. For more user-centered ICT4Ag development,
   there is now growing interest in the use of systematic, participatory
   design methodologies. OBJECTIVE: Numerous methodologies for
   participatory design exist, but applying any of them in smallholder
   farming context can create specific challenges that digital development
   researchers need to deal with. This article aims to support future
   digital development efforts by contributing practical insights to recent
   discussions on the use of participatory design methodologies for ICT4Ag
   development. METHODS: We present lessons learned from practical
   experiences within participatory design projects that developed ICT4Ag
   solutions in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Based on these
   experiences and supported by literature, we describe common challenges
   and limitations that digital designers may face in practice, and discuss
   possible opportunities for dealing with them. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:
   The outcomes of digital design projects within research-for-development
   efforts can be affected by tensions between design ideals and project
   realities. These tensions may relate to, among others, mismatching
   expectations among project stakeholders, top-down hierarchies at design
   partners, insuf- ficient attention to the wider digital ecosystem, and
   disincentives to re-use ideas and software. Depending on project
   context, these challenges may need to be addressed by researchers during
   planning and implementation of digital design projects. SIGNIFICANCE:
   The insights in this article may support agricultural development
   researchers in facilitating more effective participatory design
   processes. Even though good design is not the only precondition for a
   successful ICT4Ag service, this can help create more meaningful digital
   innovation for agricultural development.},

	abstract = {In the digital transformation of the banking sector, incorporating
   advanced technologies such as cloud computing, big data analytics,
   artificial intelligence, and blockchain has revolutionized financial
   services. However, this rapid digitalization brings significant data
   privacy and cybersecurity challenges. This study investigates the
   challenges banks have maintaining data privacy and cybersecurity while
   implementing new technologies, how they perceive these challenges, and
   what steps they take to reduce the risks involved. This qualitative
   study uses thematic analysis to examine interviews conducted with IT
   specialists in the banking sector. NVivo 14 software is employed to
   identify key themes and patterns related to the challenges, perceptions,
   and strategies regarding data privacy and cybersecurity in technology
   adoption. The findings reveal that the primary challenges faced by banks
   include integrating legacy systems, evolving compliance management,
   managing vendor risks, maintaining customer confidence, and mitigating
   emerging risks. Banks perceive robust data privacy and cybersecurity as
   critical for competitive advantage, regulatory compliance, and customer
   trust. Strategies include robust access controls, continuous threat
   monitoring, employee training, regulatory compliance with governance
   frameworks, and data encryption. This study provides original insights
   into the specific challenges and strategies related to data privacy and

	abstract = {Purpose A poor relationship between top management and IT personnel is
   often denoted as a business-IT gap. In an era of digital transformation,
   bridging this gap and establishing a strong relationship between
   business and IT are more important than ever before. The purpose of this
   paper is thus to examine a particular link between business and IT
   managers - a partnership relationship - together with the factors
   facilitating it. Design/methodology/approach A partnership construct is
   developed based on interdisciplinary studies and transferred to the
   business-IT context since it is not generally used in IT disciplines.
   The model was empirically tested with structural equation modelling
   using data obtained from 221 IT managers in Slovenian companies.
   Findings The results show that both the perceived value of IT and the
   business orientation of the IT department exert a positive influence on
   the partnership, while a mere technology-oriented IT department has a
   negative effect on the partnership relationship. Furthermore, the paper
   also presents the prerequisites for a business-oriented IT department.
   Originality/value In this digitalisation era, IT is becoming even more
   important for its strategic role in organisations. There is thus a
   strong need to bridge the business-IT gap. Despite significant efforts
   made to close this gap, it remains a major issue. This research
   contributes to understanding the business-IT gap and presents the key
   factors for ensuring a partnership relationship is in place. The study
   also combines the views of social exchange theory and knowledge-based
   theory and upgrades findings concerning the influence of social
   facilitators on collaboration outcomes.},

	abstract = {In the Global Manufacturing sector, the evolving dynamics and prospects
   of Digital Supply Chains (DSCs) are revolutionising the way Supply Chain
   (SC) actors operate and collaborate, requiring suppliers to embark on a

   current Supplier Development Programs (SDPs) have limited focus on
   building DCs for the next generation of suppliers, referred to here as
   `Suppliers 4.0'. This research presents a Reference Framework designed
   to support the creation and management of Supplier 4.0 Development
   Programs (S4.0DPs) that contribute to the digitalisation and digital
   integration of SCs through the digitalisation of their actors. The
   proposed S4.0DPs Reference Framework was validated using a two-round

	abstract = {Practitioners, policy makers as well as scholars are increasingly
   focusing their attention on the promotion of sustainable practices that
   reduce the businesses' impacts on the environment. In many cases, they
   are well aware that manufacturers and their suppliers are resorting to
   lean management processes and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies such as
   big data, internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI),
   among others, to implement sustainable production models in their
   operational processes. This research utilizes an inductive approach to
   better understand how I4.0 technologies could result in increased

	abstract = {Digital technologies are transforming how we monitor and manage natural
   resources, by speeding up data-driven decision-making. Still, to date,
   there is scant evidence of their impacts on environmental
   sustainability. In fisheries, a digital record of landings represents
   enormous potential for sustainable food production, resource management,
   and livelihoods, by making information about fish production and price
   available to all. To fill a gap in information and understanding about
   fisheries in Timor-Leste at the time, and to inform decision-making to
   renew outdated fisheries legislations and strategies, the `Peskas'
   system was developed and piloted in TimorLeste in 2017. Peskas was
   designed to collect, analyse and display small-scale fisheries data in
   near real-time to improve fisheries management through real-time
   data-driven policymaking. Using targeted interviews in key stakeholder
   groups, we assessed the progress made toward this goal through three
   different pathways over a sixyear period: i) capacity building; ii)
   partnership and collaboration; and iii) sustainable resource management.
   Results showed that the formal Government adoption of Peskas was a
   tipping point that catalysed greater intragovernmental collaboration, as
   well as between government and communities, and brought new investment
   into the fisheries sector. However, Peskas has had minimal impact on the
   development of new regulations to date. We discuss reasons for this,
   such as an inadequate fisheries legal framework and wider capacity gaps
   and draw broader recommendations for how to leverage digital
   transformation for positive change in fisheries sustainability.},

	abstract = {Grounded in the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology
   organization-environment framework, we develop an integrative model to
   study the determinants of post-adoption stages of innovation diffusion,
   using enterprise digital transformation as an example of
   technology-enabled innovations. We specify four innovation
   characteristics ( relative advantage, compatibility, costs and security
   concern) and four contextual factors ( technology competence,
   organization size, competitive pressure and partner readiness) as
   determinants of post-adoption usage, and postulate usage as an
   intermediate link to impact on firm performance. We test the proposed
   model using a dataset of 1415 companies from six European countries. We
   find that the innovation needs to be used extensively in value-chain
   activities before its impact can be realized. Among the innovation
   characteristics, we find that compatibility is the strongest driver, and
   security concern outweighs cost as a usage inhibitor. Among the
   contextual variables, technology competence, partner readiness and
   competitive pressure significantly drive e-business usage, and the
   structural inertia of large firms tends to slow down its penetration.
   Collectively, these results indicate that innovation diffusion can be
   better understood by including both innovation characteristics and
   contextual factors, whereas earlier literature has traditionally treated
   the two separately. Finally, we evaluate an international dimension
   among European countries and tease out important boundary conditions
   that would not have been evident in a single-country dataset. Our
   results show that careful attention must be paid to the economic and
   regulatory factors that may result in uneven innovation diffusion even
   among developed European countries.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To explore changes in agency/client value co-creation, at a
   time when digital transformation is having a major impact on the
   marketing communications process. The theoretical framework of the
   research relates to value co-creation in the service-for-service
   provision, a fundamental aspect of Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic)
   theory. Methodology/approach: The research was exploratory, primarily
   using qualitative methods. In addition, some quantitative survey data
   have also been included to demonstrate greater generalizability on
   certain key questions. Building on dyadic research with clients and
   their agencies, the current research includes a survey of agencies;
   interviews with clients and a follow up survey with clients. Findings:
   The nature of service-for-service provision between clients and agencies
   is outlined. Many aspects of service are equally likely to be internally
   or externally provided. This high crossover particularly relates to
   supporting aspects of digital marketing. While much digital marketing
   appears to have initially been provided externally there seems to be a
   trend to bring these aspects of service in-house. The views of clients
   and agencies on their relationship, as being either transactional or a
   partnership, appears to be related to the degree of service required and
   provided. Originality/value/contribution: Historically, the dominant
   approach to analyzing agency/clients has been to focus on relationships.
   Taking a service-for-service approach is novel and relevant in analyzing
   a context in which digitization and media fragmentation has caused
   significant changes and where the perspectives of S-D Logic have the
   potential to provide new insights, explaining aspects that are not
   covered by taking purely a relationship approach. The contribution to
   S-D Logic is at the level of midrange theory development, through
   applying ideas from S-D - Logic in the context of the application,
   helping to refine and add to the credibility of the theory. This
   exploration of the co-creation of value between clients and their
   agencies demonstrates the applicability of a framework from S-D Logic in
   a context that is an important part of marketing management.},

	abstract = {This paper delves into the growing need for collaborative technological
   solutions to address environmental challenges, with a focus on the
   underexplored potential of Industry 4.0 technologies, in particular as
   regards blockchain technology (BCT) in small and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs). Recognizing the obstacles faced by SMEs when
   embracing green and digital transformation, this research aims to
   investigate how innovation intermediaries are able to unlock the
   collaborative potential of BCT for SMEs so as to enhance their
   environmental sustainability. When assessing and analysing the role of
   innovation intermediaries, we have also considered their
   interconnections and interactions with other actors: universities,
   government institutions and firms (the so-called ``stakeholders{''}).
   Our research is based on a multiple case study of a still largely
   unexplored intermediary in the European context, the digital innovation
   hub (DIH), which extends the applicability of the technological
   innovation system framework. This approach contributes to research both
   on innovation intermediaries and on the development of collaborative
   partnerships for digitalization. The findings reveal the challenges
   encountered by DIHs, particularly in legitimizing BCT-based solutions.
   To address these, identified, weaknesses, the paper proposes a
   conceptual roadmap aimed at improving collaboration among DIHs, SMEs,
   and their stakeholders. This roadmap outlines three essential functions:
   enabling, core, and facilitating effective partnerships and innovation

   also characterise the dApp ecosystem highlighting the new types of
   parties, such as transaction validators, that are essential in the
   functioning of decentralised platforms. We show how design choices
   moderate the impact of decentralisation of the transaction system on
   digital innovation. By comparing decentralised platforms against
   centralised platforms and hierarchies, we pinpoint the limited
   opportunities for strategic action on the part of the platform provider
   to shape the direction of innovation. We speculate that the limited
   governability of blockchain platforms can give rise to an abundance of
   generativity and unpredictability in these ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Background: Telehealth services are time- and cost-saving solutions for
   disease management for older adults. Minority older individuals with
   multiple risk factors have an increasing demand for telehealth services.
   There are insufficient data on patient safety in telehealth services.
   This study aimed to enhance the quality of telehealth services by
   reducing errors and creating a safe user environment for low-income
   older adults. Failure mode and effects analysis tool (FMEA) was adopted
   to manage potential risks for sustainable digital transformation.
   Method: An eight-member multidisciplinary team conducted telehealth FMEA
   to determine risk priority numbers (RPNs). The process included
   identifying the potential cause and effect failure mode of each step;
   measuring severity, probability, and detectability scores for RPNs; and
   generating strategies to decrease potential failures.
   Results: This study identified 24 risk factors and 34 causes in four
   major phases with a mean RPN of 90.7: preparation to measure biosignals,
   measurement of biosignals following instructions from a personal device,
   confirmation of measurement results, and intervention based on disease
   or condition type. Risk prioritization revealed four high failure modes
   and a total RPN of 362.7. Based on fundamental causes, risks were
   categorized as oblivescence, economic issues, and technology literacy.
   Conclusions: To correct these failure modes, stabilization of the
   platform, adding to the providers' manpower, and support for government
   policies are recommended. FMEA identifies and evaluates the potential
   risks of telehealth services. The selected priorities reduce the
   clinical risks of low-income elders who use telehealth services by
   weighting clinical actions.},

   exchange and innovation, which is required for driving digital business
   transformation in organisations. This paper discusses the results of a
   case study that was conducted to investigate the personal ('lived')
   experiences of both industry practitioners and academics from the STEM
   academic unit at the University of Enterprise in Australia, regarding
   the barriers to building trusting knowledge-related collaborative
   relationships. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted
   with sixteen academics and industry representatives to elicit their
   views. We found that university and business leaders must overcome
   barriers to establish higher numbers of University-Industry
   Collaboration (UIC) agreements, including limited resources, lack of
   capabilities and the absence of university support. However, they must
   also address the challenges facing individual academics and industry
   professionals, such as conflicting interests and expectations, and
   limitations to academics' career progression. The paper discusses how
   the recently established Enterprise Hub at the University supports
   collaboration and fostering healthy relationships between academic staff
   and industry partners. The findings will provide guidance to other
   universities and businesses to establish such supportive entities at
   their institutions to drive innovation and digital business

	abstract = {This paper focuses on how digital innovation develops in ecologies of
   distributed heterogeneous actors with contesting logics, diverse
   technologies, and various forms of orchestrations. Drawing on the
   insights from emerging theories of digital innovation augmented by an
   institutional logics perspective, we examine a case study of how
   residential internet infrastructure was shaped over 20 years by the
   interplay of self-organized residential communities, corporate internet
   service providers (ISPs), and a state ISP. Our analysis of this case
   leads to the identification of four types of interactions that shape the
   trajectories of digital infrastructure development beyond direct actor
   interplays and competitive or collaborative relationships. We label
   these interactions symbiotic generative, symbiotic mutualistic,
   parasitic complementary, and parasitic competitive and explain the
   processes and conditions of their development and their innovation
   outcomes. Drawing on these findings, we develop a model of symbiotic and
   parasitic interactions shaping digital infrastructure development and
   identify key characteristics of the ecologies where these emerge. The
   case study and the model that emerged aim to contribute to the growing
   field of research on complex and nonlinear paths of digital innovation
   development constituted by the dynamics of its distributed agency. The
   article concludes by highlighting avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {Featured Application An analysis of terrestrial broadcasts involve
   simulcasted audio signals in both analog FM (Frequency Modulation) and
   digital DAB+ (Digital Audio Broadcasting plus) techniques, including
   different profiles of radio programs as well as type of transmitted
   content. The results of the carried-out experiments may be a valuable
   source of information for both private and public broadcasters around
   the world and not to mention various third parties interested in the
   digitization process, including content, service and network providers,
   and of course policy makers and professionals involved in the electronic
   media market. The process of digitizing radio is far from over. It is an
   important interdisciplinary aspect, involving Big Data and AI
   (Artificial Intelligence) when it comes to classifying and handling
   content, and an organizational challenge in the Industry 4.0 concept.
   There exist several methods for delivering audio signals, including
   terrestrial broadcasting and internet streaming. Among them, the DAB+
   (Digital Audio Broadcasting plus) system is one of the leading standards
   of terrestrial digital radio transmission. Compared with analog FM
   (frequency modulation) radio, it is more bandwidth efficient and offers
   greater possibilities when it comes to delivering content and forming an
   ensemble and multiplex. Currently, many countries worldwide,
   particularly European States, are still making adjustments in order to
   perform an efficient switchover from analog FM to digital DAB+ radio.
   This paper presents the current situation of the digital radio market as
   well as the results of a subjective quality evaluation study and
   questionnaire concerning broadcasting in both digital and analog
   techniques. It involves radio programs, transmitting both speech and
   music signals, simulcasted in DAB+ and FM standards. It also presents
   the development of the national multiplex. The results of this study may
   help both researchers and scientists as well as policy makers and
   professionals active in the field of broadcasting and electronic media

	abstract = {The digital transformation of businesses is no longer debatable, and the
   effects are visible in all sectors. What is arguable, however, is why
   the transformation has not been seamless-particularly given the multiple
   benefits of digitalization. We seek to address this question for the
   healthcare sector, where various reports have acknowledged end-users'
   resistance to the adoption and continued usage of technology-driven
   innovations (e-health innovations). These accounts, though, are largely
   anecdotal, and the volume of academic research in the area has remained
   rather confined. To address this paucity of insights, particularly after
   the onset of the pandemic, which has brought the healthcare sector to
   the fore, we conducted a qualitative study among healthcare providers
   (doctors, nurses, and other clinical staff). The key objective of our
   study was to identify the perceived barriers and other inhibiting
   factors that impede individuals' adoption and continued usage of
   e-health innovations. We conducted our study in the United Kingdom and
   analyzed the data using the classic approach of manual content analysis.
   Through these efforts, we identified barriers from the perspectives of
   healthcare providers (task-related, patient-care, and system barriers),
   healthcare organizations (threat perception and infrastructural
   barriers), patients (usability and resource barriers), and end-users in
   general (self-efficacy, tradition, and image barriers). Our study makes
   a noteworthy theoretical contribution by proposing a conceptual
   framework for resistance to ehealth innovations that is grounded in
   innovation resistance theory (IRT). We also make some useful suggestions
   for practice that have the potential to accelerate the diffusion of
   e-health innovations.},

	abstract = {Green innovation is an essential strategy for businesses to gain a
   competitive edge and attain long-term sustainable growth. It does,
   however, often run into money problems. The rapid advancement of digital
   technology provides organizations with potent tools to get external
   resources through digital transformation, surmount resource obstacles,
   and promote environmentally-friendly innovation. The impact mechanism,
   however, necessitates additional elucidation. This article analyzes the
   data of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2012 to 2022, using resource
   dependence theory and stakeholder theory. This study examines how
   digital transformation affects the ability of organizations to innovate
   in environmentally friendly ways by focusing on the acquisition of
   external resources. Research has shown that digital transformation may
   significantly improve the quantity and quality of green innovation in
   businesses. Moreover, the findings of the intermediate impact study
   indicate that digital transformation has the potential to enhance the
   green innovation capacity of businesses by improving their
   environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. Concurrently, we
   noticed that the level of openness in disclosing environmental
   information by corporations and the quality of partnerships between the
   government and enterprises play a positive role in influencing the
   effects of digital transformation on the ability to innovate in
   environmentally friendly ways. Based on the findings of our research, we
   provide fresh perspectives and policy suggestions to assist business
   managers and governments in fostering environmentally-friendly
   innovation in enterprises.},

	abstract = {Although digital transformation has significantly attracted scholarly
   attention beyond information systems, little is known whether
   traditional organizations can be digitally transformed alone. Knowledge
   of this process is important as traditional organizations risk failing
   to achieve digital transformation due to their lack of understanding
   about digitalization. This research proposes a conceptual framework,
   which approaches the digital transformation of traditional organizations
   as a coordinated sequence of specific relationships. The research
   propositions first outline the relationship between alliance knowledge
   and digital transformation as a necessary but not absolute condition for
   the digitalization of traditional conditions. Effectively, therefore,
   the constructs of absorptive capacity and strategic interdependence are
   considered to be boundary conditions to this relationship. Insights are
   also provided into traditional organizations' levels of absorptive
   capacity (high vs. low) as well as into the levels of interdependence
   between them and their partners (symmetry vs. asymmetry), which both
   determine the outcomes of digital transformation. Concurring with these
   propositions, this framework advances our understanding of why
   traditional organizations struggle to be digitally transformed alone and
   provides implications for both theory and practice.},

   strategies. To achieve this aim, a survey involving 73 handicraft and/or
   retail SMEs operating in luxury jewelry industry was conducted. The
   survey results pointed out that in a few years the scenario has changed
   and that surveyed SMEs make more intensive use of traditional
   technologies supporting customer knowledge management processes rather
   than more innovative digital technologies, which are also cheap and easy
   to use. This finding showed the difficulties of SMEs operating in
   creative industries to be responsive to the rapid technological changes

   crucial to adopt a risk-aware approach to ensure successful outcomes.
   This paper delves into the necessity of a risk-aware approach to digital
   procurement transformation, specifically focusing on the role of
   professional procurement management and the significance of supplier
   partnerships in the digital environment. The research aimed to examine
   the critical role of risk management in the digital transformation of
   procurement. A total of 318 respondents from Serbia participated in the
   study. The role of professional management in procurement must encompass
   risk management to guarantee success in digital procurement
   transformation. Furthermore, the study identified that adequate
   preparation, information, and training for individuals involved are
   crucial for a seamless transition to digital procurement. The digital
   transformation of procurement contributes to sustainability by enhancing
   efficiency, transparency, and collaboration across the supply chain,
   ultimately fostering environmentally conscious practices and responsible
   resource management. In summary, the research underscores the need for a

	abstract = {The relevance of the study is dictated by the growing role of the fuel
   and energy complex of developing countries in the decarbonization of the
   economy. The article discusses the digital transformation of mining
   enterprises in Kazakhstan, taking into account the transition to CRIRSCO
   international standards and growing competition in the global mineral
   market. The purpose of the study is to assess the current level of
   digitalization of the mining industry in Kazakhstan and to deepen the
   methodological apparatus of the geological and economic assessment of
   the enterprise based on the factual base of deposits. The role of the
   transformation of the mining sector in achieving the sustainability of
   the poorly diversified economy of Kazakhstan is shown. The importance of
   digitalization of the industry to complete the transition to CRIRSCO
   international standards and improve the assessment of the digital
   provision of enterprises in order to optimize their financial and
   economic policies is argued. It has been established that, at present,
   most of the enterprises in the investment-attractive mining sector have
   a low potential for the transition to a new technological paradigm. A
   methodological approach to the geological and economic assessment of
   these enterprises has been developed. To maintain high standards of
   management transparency through the digitalization of key business
   processes, along with well-known practices of economic analysis, the
   IDEF1 methodology was used. In order to expand the software ecosystem,
   the formats of electronic geological and economic databases are
   integrated into the digital infrastructure of the enterprise. It is
   substantiated that the introduction of high technologies in the mining
   industry requires institutional changes and coordinated interaction
   between the state, business, and universities as equal partners.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Our research is set in the context the digital
   transformation of a large French telecommunications company. We present
   the results of an empirical study on the information behaviour of the
   top managers of telecoms network units and on the factors that influence
   them.
   Method. The qualitative study consisted of twenty-two interviews
   conducted with senior executive-engineers who occupied leadership
   positions in the company's network units. The main data were collected
   using Dervin's sense-making interviewing approach.
   Analysis. The data relative to sense-making situations was coded using
   sense-making methods. We also used grounded theory techniques to analyse
   our interview transcripts with the support of the Nvivo software.
   Results. The predominant aspect of information security and the
   expansion of the concept of `space', in which top managers situate their
   information activity, were highlighted by our model. Other determining
   factors were: work roles and tasks, the company's culture and values,
   and situational constraints and time.
   Conclusions. A model of the information behaviour of top managers was
   derived from the results of this empirical study. The model contributes
   to understanding of the information behaviour and constraints of
   executives in work situations. Looking forward, it could be used to
   explore the information activity of other groups of managers.},

	abstract = {Featured Application Companies can implement the digital maturity
   assessment model to assess the digital maturity of their logistics
   processes. In turn, the results presented in the research can provide
   benchmarking data for companies that create digital transformation maps
   for their use.Abstract (1) Background: Industry 4.0 and the COVID-19
   pandemic have resulted in an acceleration of digital transformation,
   primarily in production systems and logistics. This raises the need to
   assess where a company is in its digital transformation today and what
   measures must be taken to improve logistics processes. This article aims
   to present the results of a study assessing the digital maturity of
   logistics processes in a group of selected enterprises located in
   Poland. The research was conducted among companies that are business
   partners of the Poznan School of Logistics. (2) Methods: The DMM-OP
   digital process maturity assessment model was used in the study. Digital
   maturity was assessed on a five-point scale in four areas of company
   activity: process management, performance measurement, employee support,
   and technology. The research procedure included four stages. (3)
   Results: The results indicate that companies in the process management
   and performance measurement dimensions achieved the highest level of
   digital maturity. In commercial enterprises, the level of digital
   transformation is at the lowest level. Large enterprises achieved the
   best results, but there were also very good results in the group of
   small enterprises. (4) Conclusions: The results presented in the article
   can be used by industry and academia. The research was not statistical
   but can form the basis for benchmarking analyses.},

	abstract = {The impact of digital transformation (DT) on open innovation (OI) has
   attracted growing interest. However, the nuanced effects of various
   forms of coupled OI on innovation outcomes remain underexplored. This
   study aims to investigate the differential impacts of coupled OI modes
   on innovation performance within the context of DT driven by Industry
   4.0 technologies. To test the hypotheses, we used Heckman's two-stage
   estimation utilizing the Korean Innovation Survey 2022. The findings
   reveal that collaborative activities as coupled OI modes positively
   impact innovation performance. Furthermore, the adoption of Industry 4.0
   technologies amplifies the positive impact of research and development
   (R\&D) collaborations on business process innovation while diminishing
   the positive effect of non-R\&D collaborations on new product
   development. This study's contribution to the literature lies in its
   finding that the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies can only be
   beneficial to firms when DT guides the focal firm on being more
   cooperative in R\&D collaboration activities and therefore helps focal
   firms to use innovation opportunities efficiently and more rapidly and
   to innovate diverse business processes. In practice, a firm should have
   sufficient capabilities to rigorously analyze DT-adoption data to
   capture market needs.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The objective of this study is to examine the influences of
   green supply chain integration, digital transformation of the supply
   chain, and environmental uncertainty on corporate green innovation.
   Moreover, relevant policy suggestions are put forward to facilitate the
   sustainable development of corporate green innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the literature research
   method to sort out variables to understand the current situation as the
   foundation for our study, uses the questionnaire survey method to create
   a questionnaire to collect data, and analyzes the data with the help of
   the empirical research method to verify our hypotheses to draw
   conclusions. Findings: Green supply chain integration positively
   promotes corporate green innovation and also positively affects supply
   chain digital transformation, which in turn positively promotes
   corporate green innovation. Moreover, supply chain digital
   transformation acts as a mediator, while environmental uncertainty plays
   a moderating role and affects green supply chain integration and green
   innovation. Originality/value: This study delves into how green supply
   chain integration, with green internal integration, green supplier
   integration, and green customer integration as its independent
   variables, affects the green innovation of domestic manufacturing
   enterprises. By doing so, it breaks new ground for empirical research in
   this area and offers theoretical directions for the green innovation
   efforts of enterprises. Meanwhile, in the digital era, from the overall
   supply chain perspective, we break through the limitations of previously
   studied intermediary variables. We construct a theoretical model by
   integrating supply chain digital transformation and environmental
   uncertainty variables and explore the variable influence paths. This can
   fill the research gaps, lay a solid theoretical groundwork for enhancing
   enterprise sustainable development, and open a new path for enterprise
   growth.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation of the energy industry is at the vanguard of
   promoting green and low-carbon development of energy, and the
   transformation and upgrading of the energy industry is a critical path
   to achieve the goal of ``dual carbon.{''} The study takes energy
   enterprises, digital technology providers, and local governments in
   China as the research objects, then by constructing a three-party
   dynamic differential game model, four scenarios are considered
   respectively. The optimal digitization effort, digitization level,
   carbon emission reduction expectations, and optimal benefits of each
   subject are studied. The results show that: (1) Government subsidies
   function as an effective regulating mechanism, helping regulate the
   profit distribution of energy enterprises. With government subsidies,
   cost-sharing contracts can improve the profits of energy enterprises and
   digital service providers and enhance industry digitization and carbon
   emission reduction to some extent. (2) When there are government
   subsidies, the optimal digitalization efforts of energy enterprises and
   the optimal subsidy coefficient of government under the three decisions
   are independent of time. The extent to which subsidies improve system
   members' income is correlated to its game structure and status. (3) In
   the centralized decision-making state, digitalization level, product
   emission reduction, and total system profit are higher than in the
   decentralized decision-making state, which can better help the overall
   revenue system composed of energy enterprises, digital service
   providers, and local governments to achieve economic and environmental
   optimization at the same time and reach the Pareto optimal state. (4)
   With government subsidies and after the introduction of contracts, when
   certain conditions are met, the followers' optimal digital effort level,
   product emission reduction, digitization level, demand and profits of
   each member are all improved except for the leader's optimal effort
   level, Pareto improvement of profits of all participating members in the
   system is realized.},

	abstract = {The digital transformation of the public sector is a crucial objective
   for the European Commission and member states. Concerns arise due to US
   and Chinese tech giants' dominance in cloud computing, impacting
   sovereignty, privacy, and security. Some European member states
   established restrictions on non-EU Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to
   ensure compliance with European data protection laws. Investigating how
   states respond to growingly infrastructuralized non-EU public CSPs is
   crucial. This paper scrutinizes the Italian Cloud Strategy in the
   context of the public sector's migration to the cloud. Critical and
   interpretive policy analysis tools are employed to examine the
   Strategy's underlying problematizations and prevailing discourses. The
   paper argues that while the Italian Strategy recognizes the trade-off
   between pragmatism and sovereignty, it lacks comprehensive solutions.
   The unquestioned dominance of non-EU public CSPs, symbolic proposals,
   and limitations in data classification call for further considerations
   to strike a balance between pragmatism and safeguarding digital
   sovereignty.},

	abstract = {Growing environmental problems and the awakening of public environmental
   awareness have led to a global green movement and increased attention to
   firms' environmental performance (EP). However, few studies have focused
   on how and when supplier concentration (SC) affects firms' EP. In the
   institutional context of China, this study explores the intrinsic
   mechanism through which SC acts on EP and its heterogeneous relationship
   from a relational perspective. Empirical tests are conducted via a
   dataset of Chinese listed companies from 2008 to 2022. We find that SC
   contributes significantly to firms' EP, and this effect has a long-term
   effect. Moreover, trade credit, innovation ability, and human capital
   constitute important transmission channels for these results. In
   addition, we find that the positive effect of SC on firms' EP is more
   significant when the firms are non-state owned or located in regions
   with better transportation infrastructure and digital transformation. By
   exploring for the first time the important role of SC in predicting a
   firm's EP, this study provides new insights into the literature.},

@article{WOS:001327540700001,
	abstract = {PurposeAccording to reputation theory, enterprises that adopt a
   proactive approach to corporate social responsibility (CSR) are known to
   actively invest in corporate innovation. However, this theory does not
   fully explain the mechanisms through which CSR influences corporate
   innovation, nor does it address how to effectively amplify CSR's
   positive impact on innovation. To overcome these limitations, this
   research aims to incorporate the theories of innovation investment and
   dynamic capabilities. Innovation investment theory elucidates how CSR
   can attract additional financing, which can be directed toward
   innovation activities. Meanwhile, dynamic capabilities theory highlights
   how digital transformation in enterprises can enhance the positive
   effects of CSR on innovation, providing insights from both theoretical
   and empirical perspectives.Design/methodology/approachTo demonstrate the
   mediating role of debt financing costs and the moderating role of
   enterprise digital transformation in the mechanism of CSR on corporate
   innovation, this research conducts fixes effects models by collecting
   27,912 data points from 3,775A-share China-listed enterprises, ranging
   in period from 2010 to 2020. Empirical research once again proves that
   the theories of innovation investment and dynamic capabilities
   effectively compensates for the shortcomings of reputation theory. These
   three theories effectively explain that what is the effect of CSR on
   enterprise innovation? How does CSR influence corporate innovation? And
   through what mechanisms can CSR better enhance corporate
   innovation?FindingsAccording to innovation investment theory, the cost
   of debt financing mediates the positive relationship between CSR and
   corporate innovation. This occurs because enterprises with robust CSR
   practices are more likely to secure external funding, thereby reducing
   their costs associated with external debt financing. Lower debt
   financing costs provide a stable source of funds for corporate
   innovation. Additionally, dynamic capability theory suggests that
   enterprise digital transformation moderates the positive relationship
   between CSR and corporate innovation. Building on these insights, it is
   recommended that enterprises, especially state-owned ones, should
   prioritize technological innovation to enhance their
   competitiveness.Research limitations/implicationsThis research aims to
   address and narrow the knowledge gap regarding the relation between CSR
   and corporate innovation through theoretical and empirical analyses.
   With respect to the influence mechanism, this research solely based on
   innovation investment theory and dynamic capabilities theory, focuses on
   the influence mechanism of CSR on corporate innovation, with the debt
   financing costs as the mediating variable and digital transformation as
   the moderating variable. However, the influence mechanism turns out to
   be complicated and there is room for further exploring numerous
   mechanisms. For example, future research can focus on identifying
   additional channels through which CSR exerts an influence on corporate
   innovation based on TOE theoretical framework.Practical implicationsThis
   research presents several strategies to enhance corporate innovation
   based on its conclusions: First, enterprises should promptly publish
   social responsibility reports to build a positive industry reputation.
   Moreover, by actively participating in CSR activities, they can
   strengthen their networks and enhance their industry standing. Second,
   the significant mediating role of debt financing costs should not be
   ignored.
   Enterprises are encouraged to seek diverse financing channels to reduce
   financial pressures, address financing challenges and facilitate the
   coordinated development of CSR and innovation. Third, enterprise digital
   transformation significantly affects the impact of CSR on innovation.
   Therefore, enterprises should advance digital transformation initiatives
   that incorporate technological innovation, organizational improvements
   and integration with supply chain partners. Finally, it has been noted
   that state-owned enterprises are often less responsive to technological
   innovation than their non-state counterparts. SOEs could redefine the
   scope and priorities of their social responsibilities to prevent
   excessive resource consumption that could hinder innovation. For
   instance, integrating some of their social responsibilities with
   innovation projects could promote both social and technological
   innovation objectives. Additionally, the government could ensure fair
   resource distribution among different types of enterprises and provide
   an equitable financing platform to mitigate financial challenges for
   both state-owned and non-state-owned
   enterprises.Originality/valueReputation theory does not fully elucidate
   the mechanisms by which CSR influences corporate innovation or how to
   effectively enhance CSR's positive impact on innovation. This research
   integrates the theories of innovation investment and dynamic
   capabilities to address these gaps. According to innovation investment
   theory, debt financing costs mediate the positive relationship between
   CSR and corporate innovation. Meanwhile, dynamic capabilities theory
   posits that enterprise digital transformation moderates this positive
   relationship, further strengthening the impact of CSR on innovation.},

	abstract = {Innovation in ecosystems becomes increasingly attractive for incumbents
   as the technical complexity increases and complementarities play an
   increasingly important role for global competition. Digital platforms
   are becoming one of the primary means to that end, where incumbents can
   gain scale effects and reap the benefits of the creative crowd while
   maintaining ownership of the core product. But a lion's share of these
   platforms hinges on the accessibility of data, and the view of the value
   of this data differs among actors in the system. This paper accounts for
   a case study of two type actors in an innovation ecosystem: the core
   actor (OEM) and the peripheral actor (third party service provider).
   From interviews with representatives of these actors, we find that their
   perspectives on the data and its usefulness outside its intended context
   differ. We label the perspectives purposive and multi-contextual; we
   formulate their descriptions and outline managerial implications. We
   argue that these differing perspectives are at the crux of establishing
   innovation capabilities in ecosystems based on digital platforms.},

	abstract = {Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-anticipated digital
   transformation of traditional retail has become the new reality.
   Retailers are responding to changes in consumers' shopping behaviours
   and their demand for new interaction channels and touchpoints to shop at
   their convenience, regardless of time and location. Consequently,
   retailers are experiencing a change from single-channel models to
   multi-channel and omnichannel models. Omnichannel retailing demands
   integrated channel management and operation to improve customers'
   shopping experiences. This study uses measures of channel integration
   levels from previous research to analyse channel integration among
   leading vendors in three top retailing sectors (clothing and apparel,
   home furniture and grocery) and expands the analysis by including
   indicators of digital transformation. The model includes 27 indicators
   related to channel integration and 9 indicators of digital
   transformation, and compares the results across sectors. By so doing,
   the study also aims to help establish values that may be used as target
   or reference values of channel integration and digitalization of
   retailers across sectors, irrespective of their size. The research
   methodology uses the `mystery shopper' technique and includes the
   collection of data about the 165 leading companies in these sectors in

   learning health and care systems, which can be defined as health and
   care systems that continuously use data-enabled infrastructure to
   support policy and planning, public health, and personalisation of care.
   The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an opportunity to assess how well
   equipped the UK is to leverage health information technology and apply
   the principles of a national learning health and care system in response
   to a major public health shock. With the experience acquired during the
   pandemic, each country within the UK should now re-evaluate their
   digital health and care strategies. After leaving the EU, UK countries
   now need to decide to what extent they wish to engage with European
   efforts to promote interoperability between electronic health records.
   Major priorities for strengthening health information technology in the
   UK include achieving the optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up
   implementation, improving usability and interoperability, developing
   capacity for handling, processing, and analysing data, addressing
   privacy and security concerns, and encouraging digital inclusivity.
   Current and future opportunities include integrating electronic health
   records across health and care providers, investing in health data
   science research, generating real-world data, developing artificial
   intelligence and robotics, and facilitating public-private partnerships.
   Many ethical challenges and unintended consequences of implementation of
   health information technology exist. To address these, there is a need
   to develop regulatory frameworks for the development, management, and
   procurement of artificial intelligence and health information technology
   systems, create public-private partnerships, and ethically and safely

	abstract = {Using the data of listed agriculture-affiliated companies with
   customer-supplier association information, we examine the diffusion
   effect of the digitalisation of listed agricultural companies on the
   digital transformation of agriculture-affiliated enterprises from the
   perspective of supply chain. We show that the supply chain diffusion
   effect of digitalisation mainly exists in `customer
   enterprises-suppliers enterprises' and `leading enterprises-other
   enterprises'. And the digital transformation of agriculture-affiliated
   customer enterprises forces suppliers to respond to customer innovation
   demands, thereby improving the digitalisation level of suppliers, while
   leading agriculture-affiliated enterprises improve the digitisation
   level of other agriculture-affiliated enterprises in the supply chain
   network through knowledge flow. Additionally, the supply chain diffusion
   effect of digital transformation is stronger under the conditions of
   smaller `digital divide', lower geographic distance, the downstream
   consumer end and more government support of agriculture-affiliated
   enterprises. We provide theoretical and practical implications for
   promoting the digitalisation of the entire agricultural chain and
   improving the scale effect of digitalisation.},

	abstract = {The business landscape has significantly changed in the last few years
   due to unforeseen incidents such as the recent pandemic and war in
   Europe. While such incidents have interrupted or even impaired economies
   and businesses, they have also accelerated digitalization. Parallel to
   this, many countries have started moving towards sustainability and
   realized the importance of circularity on a large scale. Thus,
   international industrial firms must deal with new regulations. Despite
   the growth of research on digitalization and circular economy, our
   understanding of international industrial manufacturers and their
   business models, in particular, is limited. Thus, this research aims to
   study international industrial manufacturers digitally enabled circular
   business models. A case study approach covered a case company, six
   partners, three sister companies, and the parent company. The findings
   reveal the characteristics of a digitally enabled circular business
   model and its outcomes, including resource utilization, supply chain,
   and sustainable efficiency. Theoretical and managerial implications are

	abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of studying digitization transformation of the supply
   chain is to understand how digital technologies and processes are
   changing the way supply chains operate and to identify the opportunities
   and challenges associated with this transformation. Studying
   digitization transformation of the supply chain is important because it
   can help global businesses in identifying the best practices in supply
   chain management (SCM) systems and enhance supply chain performance.
   Hence, this research study is contributing in revealing the outcomes of
   digital inclusiveness in overall SCM for the growth of retail and
   e-commerce based platforms.Design/methodology/approachThis research is
   using both descriptive and explanatory research designs to provide a
   comprehensive understanding of the problems in SCM. Descriptive research
   provides a detailed description of the characteristics of the population
   under study, while explanatory research identifies the causal
   relationships between the variables. Descriptive research has helped us
   to develop hypotheses about the relationships between variables that can
   be tested using explanatory research. Explanatory research has been used
   to validate the findings of descriptive research. By using both
   descriptive and explanatory research designs, our research design has
   increased the generalizability of our findings.FindingsAccording to this
   study, businesses intend to change their supply chain strategies after
   the wake of competitive era to make them more robust, sustainable and
   collaborative with suppliers, customers and stakeholders by investing
   more in SCM technology like Blockchain, AI, analytics, robotic process
   automation and data control centers. This study evaluates the impact of
   digitization on supply chain systems. This includes assessing the
   benefits of digitization and identifying the factors that contribute to
   successful implementation. This research is studying the role of data
   analytics in SCM and how it can be leveraged to improve efficiency,
   reduce costs and increase transparency.Research
   limitations/implicationsThe study highlights the importance of adopting
   digitization in supply chain systems to improve supply chain robustness,
   sustainability and collaboration with stakeholders. This study's
   emphasis on data analytics in SCM presents an opportunity for businesses
   to gain insights into their supply chain systems and make data-driven
   decisions. This can enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve overall
   supply chain performance. The study's focus on SCM technology and data
   analytics may overlook other factors that contribute to successful SCM,
   such as organizational culture, human resources and supply chain
   governance.Originality/valueThis study will complement to the existing
   body of information, management theory and practice and will benefit
   all. The research work is original and can be implemented worldwide to
   promote digitization in SCM for smooth transactions in the entire chain
   of wholesalers, retail distributors and customers.},

	abstract = {Smart manufacturing platform has become an important carrier of digital
   transformation of manufacturing industry. However, due to the capital
   and technology constraints of manufacturing enterprises, a cross-border
   cooperation mode with cloud service providers has emerged. To expand
   users' scale and enhance competitive-ness, the manufacturing enterprise
   and the cloud service provider have focused on investing in value-added
   service (VAS) based on their resource endowments. Based on differential
   game theory and Bellman's contin-uous dynamic planning theory, this
   study investigates dynamic cooperative VAS efforts decisions of the
   platform considering network effect and altruism preference. The results
   show that the network effect can stimulate the VAS efforts level of both
   manufacturer and cloud service provider. Moreover, the manufacturer's
   altruistic preference weakens the double marginal effect, which is
   conducive to improve the profit of the platform system, the VAS efforts
   level and the profit of the cloud service provider. However, the
   manufacturer's effort level is not affected by the manufacturer's
   altruistic preference, and it only benefits the manufacturer when the
   manufac-turer's altruistic preference coefficient is less than a certain
   threshold. In addition, the manufacturer derives far less profit growth
   from altruistic preference than the cloud provider does.},

	abstract = {Advanced workplace technologies are increasingly used alongside
   traditional enterprise software packages (such as enterprise resource
   planning) in the workplace. However, we have only limited understanding
   of how different kinds of technologies are used to dynamically shape
   work routines and fluidity in a digital workplace. We conducted an
   in-depth six-year study of the use of enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   system by a large information technology service provider company. The
   company used the system to manage its global staffing processes. We
   explored how the users of this system sought to achieve the fluidity
   needed to do their work. Our findings show that users balance two
   patterns of routine performance through different technologies with
   varying degrees of malleability: one to generate fluidity and another to
   generate stability. We call this process `generative balancing'. Our
   research contributes to the literature on workplace technologies and ERP
   use by providing insights into how the use of technologies with
   different degrees of malleability helps to craft digital workspaces and
   enables users to deal with tensions between accomplishing local-level

	abstract = {Food retailing is now on an accelerated path to a success penetration
   into the digital market by new ways of value creation at all stages of
   the consumer decision process. One of the most important imperatives in
   this path is the availability of quality data to feed all the process in
   digital transformation. However, the quality of data are not so obvious
   if we consider the variety of products and suppliers in the grocery
   market. Within this context of digital transformation of grocery
   industry, Midiadia is a Spanish data provider company that works on
   converting data from the retailers' products into knowledge with
   attributes and insights from the product labels that is maintaining
   quality data in a dynamic market with a high dispersion of products.
   Currently, they manually categorize products (groceries) according to
   the information extracted directly (text processing) from the product
   labelling and packaging. This paper introduces a solution to
   automatically categorize the constantly changing product catalogue into
   a 3-level food taxonomy. Our proposal studies three different
   approaches: a score-based ranking method, traditional machine learning
   algorithms, and deep neural networks. Thus, we provide four different
   classifiers that support a more efficient and less error-prone
   maintenance of groceries catalogues, the main asset of the company.
   Finally, we have compared the performance of these three alternatives,
   concluding that traditional machine learning algorithms perform better,
   but closely followed by the score-based approach.},

	abstract = {Background Contending with a continuously expanding volume and variety
   of clinical data poses challenges and opportunities for the industry and
   clinical data management organizations. Methods Tufts CSDD conducted an
   online survey aimed at further quantifying and understanding the
   magnitude and impact that expanded data volume, sources and diversity
   are having on clinical trials. The survey was distributed between
   October and December 2019. Responses from a total of 149 individuals
   were included in the final analysis. Results The survey found that
   companies use or pilot from one to six different data sources with the
   majority of respondents using or piloting 3-4 different sources of data
   in their clinical trials. The results showed that average times to
   database lock have increased an average 5 days compared to a 2017 study,
   possibly as a result of managing an even larger number of data sources.
   Finally, three key mitigation strategies surfaced as techniques
   respondents used to tackle expanding data volume, sources, and
   diversity: the creation of a formalized data strategy, investment in new
   analytics tools and more sophisticated data technology infrastructures,
   and the development of new data science disciplines. Conclusion Without
   further investments into infrastructure and developments of additional
   mitigation techniques in this area, database lock cycle times are likely
   to continue to increase as more and more data supporting a clinical
   trial are coming from nontraditional, CRF sources. Further research must
   be done into organizations who are handling these challenges
   appropriately.},

	abstract = {Goal:The COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare market disruptors, and new
   digital healthcare technologies have made a substantial impact on the
   delivery of healthcare services, highlighting the critical roles of
   leaders in hospitals and health systems. This study sought to understand
   the evolving roles of CEOs, CIOs, and other executive leaders in the
   postpandemic era and highlight the adaptability and strategic vision of
   executives in shaping the future of healthcare delivery.Methods:Between
   October 2022 and May 2023, 51 interviews were conducted with CEOs, CIOs,
   and other executives responsible for delivering technology solutions for
   33 nonprofit health systems in the United States. They were asked to
   describe their backgrounds; how information solutions and technologies
   were viewed within their organizations' strategy, operations, and
   governance; and the key characteristics of executive leaders.Principal
   Findings:The study has found that effective CEOs have an authentic
   belief in technology's role in achieving their organization's mission
   and that contemporary CIOs are strategic executive partners who align
   strategy with culture to improve care. This study examines how
   healthcare systems are creating digitally savvy executive leadership
   teams that operate in a new, integrated model that unites previously
   siloed functions.Practical Applications:Some healthcare CIOs are
   unprepared for current and future business challenges, and some CEOs are
   unsure how to leverage digital technologies and C-suite expertise to
   transform their organizations. This research provides insights into how
   the nation's health systems are building and sustaining leadership teams
   capable of adapting to the healthcare environment and accelerating
   organizational transformation.},

	abstract = {BackgroundImplementation of digital monitoring technology systems is
   considered beneficial for increasing the safety and quality of care for
   residents in nursing homes and simultaneously improving care providers'
   workflow. Co-creation is a suitable approach for developing and
   implementing digital technologies and transforming the service
   accordingly. This study aimed to identify the facilitators and barriers
   for implementation of digital monitoring technology in residential care
   for persons with dementia and wandering behaviour, and explore
   co-creation as an implementation strategy and practice.MethodsIn this
   longitudinal case study, we observed and elicited the experiences of
   care providers and healthcare managers in eight nursing homes, in
   addition to those of the information technology (IT) support services
   and technology vendors, during a four-year implementation process. We
   were guided by theories on innovation, implementation and learning, as
   well as co-creation and design. The data were analysed deductively using
   a determinants of innovation framework, followed by an inductive content
   analysis of interview and observation data.ResultsThe implementation
   represented radical innovation and required far more resources than the
   incremental changes anticipated by the participants. Five categories of
   facilitators and barriers were identified, including several
   subcategories for each category: 1) Pre-implementation preparations; 2)
   Implementation strategy; 3) Technology stability and usability; 4)
   Building competence and organisational learning; and 5) Service
   transformation and quality management. The combination of IT
   infrastructure instability and the reluctance of the IT support service
   to contribute in co-creating value with the healthcare services was the
   most persistent barrier. Overall, the co-creation methodology was the
   most prominent facilitator, resulting in a safer night monitoring
   service.ConclusionSuccessful implementation of novel digital monitoring
   technologies in the care service is a complex and time-consuming process
   and even more so when the technology allows care providers to radically
   transform clinical practices at the point of care, which offers new
   affordances in the co-creation of value with their residents. From a
   long-term perspective, the digital transformation of municipal
   healthcare services requires more advanced IT competence to be
   integrated directly into the management and provision of healthcare and
   value co-creation with service users and their relatives.},

   towards Industry 4.0 (I4.0) in manufacturing value chain. Starting from
   the analysis of the literature on values and impacts of digitalization
   and I4.0 in operations and supply chain management, the research
   investigates three key dimensions to take into account when defining the
   digital transformation path from a managerial perspective: investments
   in I4.0 technologies, ability in perceiving the path towards digital
   transformation, and knowledge sharing. For each dimension, patterns of
   managerial practices and related challenges for the implementation of
   the I4.0 paradigm has been identified, building on the insights and
   experiences of different players of the manufacturing supply chain
   (companies, ranging from large enterprises to SMEs, service and
   technology providers, competence centres). The results proposed in terms
   of key challenges, common mistakes and best practices according to the
   level of digital implementation, represent an overview of reference that

	abstract = {Open data platforms freely provide citizens with access to public data,
   thus enabling improved governance transparency, enhanced public
   services, and increased civic engagement. However, unlocking the
   potential of this digital transformation strategy requires that public
   institutions manage the tension between public and private interests.
   Furthermore, even when public institutions break down traditional
   barriers for citizens' access to data, the potential users often lack
   the knowledge to leverage it in meaningful ways. Open data platforms
   therefore tend to fall short of expectations. Leveraging a 10-year
   action design research study (ADR) in the Swedish Transport
   Administration (STA), this paper develops design principles for creating
   valuegenerating open data platforms in the public domain. The ADR
   project was initiated to assist STA in its efforts to deal with outlaw
   innovators who scraped train data from different websites to develop
   travel apps. Through three iterative design cycles that eventually led
   to the formation of a new open data platform, the outlaw innovators
   increasingly became valued partners in the digital transformation
   process. Theorizing this development process, this paper offers three
   design principles that provide guidance to public institutions aspiring
   to digitally transform by making public data accessible. We also reflect
   upon how these institutions might mitigate the risks associated with
   partnering with outlaw innovators in the pursuit of an open data
   strategy.},

	abstract = {In the context of global digital transformation, computing resources
   have become a critical production factor, profoundly impacting corporate
   operational efficiency, innovation capability, and supply chain
   management, particularly in the area of trade credit financing. This
   paper delves into how computing resources influence corporate trade
   credit supply, with a particular focus on their application within
   supply chains. The research indicates that computing resources
   significantly enhance the capacity of enterprises to provide trade
   credit, fostering trust and collaboration among supply chain partners.
   Mechanism analysis reveals that computing resources, through
   technological effects, accelerate information processing and
   transmission, reducing information asymmetry within the supply chain,
   thereby increasing transparency, trust, and the motivation to supply
   trade credit. Through capital effect, computing resources strengthen a
   company's ability to access external funding, alleviate financing
   constraints, and optimize financing costs, thereby enhancing trade
   credit supply capacity. This impact is more pronounced in state-owned
   enterprises, mature companies, and those operating in superior business
   environments. This study highlights the vital role of computing
   resources as an emerging key factor in trade credit supply, particularly
   in enhancing cooperation and trust among supply chain partners,
   enriching our understanding of corporate operational mechanisms in the
   digital economy era. By deeply analyzing the effects of computing
   resources on the efficiency and reliability of trade credit supply, this
   paper not only provides theoretical support for companies in optimizing
   financing management during digital transformation but also offers
   valuable insights for policymakers in promoting digital upgrades and
   building a more stable and transparent supply chain finance system.},

	abstract = {The impacts of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) on supply chains have garnered
   increasing attention, but limited empirical research explores how
   buyer-supplier relationships (BSRs) evolve in specific sectors. This
   article investigates the maturity of Brazilian companies in adapting
   their BSR under I4.0, focusing on the automotive, chemical, and
   agribusiness sectors. A survey involving 38 experts in I4.0 applications
   in supply chains assessed BSR development within these sectors in
   Brazil. Data were analysed using Grey Fixed Weight Clustering, enabling
   the inclusion of uncertainty in the evaluation. The findings highlight
   that electronic and automated communication modes are prevalent across
   all sectors, reflecting the growing integration of digital technologies
   in supply chains. Sector-specific factors, including market dynamics and
   regulatory standards, significantly influence BSRs, emphasising the need
   for tailored management strategies. The maturity analysis underscores
   the critical role of trust, collaborative partnerships, and automation
   in enhancing BSRs within I4.0 environments. This research provides
   empirical evidence of I4.0's impact on BSRs, offering insights for
   stakeholders to prioritise efforts and formulate strategies addressing
   technological and regulatory challenges. By advancing conceptual
   understanding of maturity and offering targeted strategies to improve

   The pandemic can be seen as an opportunity to revisit the justification
   for conferences and how they should be run to avoid elitism, climate
   impact, and diversity.
   2020 saw a wealth of different approaches to events, including
   financing, technologies, scheduling, and the meaning of the term `live'.
   Engaging attendees and providing networking opportunities are considered
   the main obstacle to virtual events, but can social networking lessons
   help resolve - or even improve - this?
   It may take some time for online event programming to achieve the right
   balance of flexibility versus `buzz' to meet a conference's key
   objectives: knowledge sharing and peer interaction.
   Live broadcasting is on the rise, but the on-demand video model is
   gaining popularity as it ensures high-quality presentation recordings
   and consistency of experience.
   Over time, technical challenges of online meetings will resolve, with
   competition leading to more reasonable pricing, customers becoming
   savvier, and vendors learning from experience.},

	abstract = {Background: The English Global Digital Exemplar (GDE) program is one of
   the first concerted efforts to create a digital health learning
   ecosystem across a national health service.
   Objective: This study aims to explore mechanisms that support or inhibit
   the exchange of interorganizational digital transformation knowledge.
   Methods: We conducted a formative qualitative evaluation of the GDE
   program. We used semistructured interviews with clinical, technical, and
   managerial staff; national program managers and network leaders;
   nonparticipant observations of knowledge transfer activities through
   attending meetings, workshops, and conferences; and documentary analysis
   of policy documents. The data were thematically analyzed by drawing on a
   theory-informed sociotechnical coding framework. We used a mixture of
   deductive and inductive methods, supported by NVivo software, to
   facilitate coding.
   Results: We conducted 341 one-on-one and 116 group interviews, observed
   86 meetings, and analyzed 245 documents from 36 participating provider
   organizations. We also conducted 51 high-level interviews with policy
   makers and vendors; performed 77 observations of national meetings,
   workshops, and conferences; and analyzed 80 national documents. Formal
   processes put in place by the GDE program to initiate and reinforce
   knowledge transfer and learning have accelerated the growth of informal
   knowledge networking and helped establish the foundations of a learning
   ecosystem. However, formal networks were most effective when supported
   by informal networking. The benefits of networking were enhanced (and
   costs reduced) by geographical proximity, shared culture and context,
   common technological functionality, regional and strategic alignments,
   and professional agendas.
   Conclusions: Knowledge exchange is most effective when sustained through
   informal networking driven by the mutual benefits of sharing knowledge
   and convergence between group members in their organizational and
   technological setting and goals. Policy interventions need to enhance
   incentives and reduce barriers to sharing across the ecosystem, be
   flexible in tailoring formal interventions to emerging needs, and
   promote informal knowledge sharing.},

	abstract = {{[}Research Purpose] In the era of the digital economy, there is an
   urgent need to explore solutions to various problems faced by
   enterprises in their digital transformation, such as the lack of data
   resources, data silos, and information asymmetry within supply chains.
   {[}Method/Contribution] Leveraging evolutionary game theory and adopting
   a supply chain perspective, this study integrates the government and
   upstream/downstream enterprises into a unified analysis framework. In
   this study, a three-party evolutionary game model under government
   coordination aimed at fostering data openness and sharing among supply
   chain enterprises is constructed. Simulation analyses are conducted on
   decision-making strategies concerning data sharing between the
   government and supply chain enterprises across different scenarios.
   {[}Research Conclusion] It is observed that the high level of benefits
   and low costs associated with data sharing incentivize supply chain
   enterprises to actively open and share their data. Notably, government
   incentives significantly encourage data openness among these enterprises
   by subsidizing the cost of data sharing, ``especially evident when the
   incentive coefficient exceeds 0.6,{''} thereby guiding them toward
   collaborative data-sharing initiatives. Finally, it is also found that
   data sharing further promotes the digital transformation of the supply
   chain, optimizing decisionmaking processes, resource allocation, and
   operational efficiency. Through data sharing, better forecasting,
   inventory management, and risk mitigation strategies can be implemented.
   Moreover, data sharing fosters collaboration among supply chain partners
   enhances transparency and trust, and makes the supply chain more
   synchronized and responsive, which leads to value cocreation within the
   supply chain, with downstream enterprises being more incentivized than
   upstream enterprises by this value cocreation.},

	abstract = {Vendor capabilities development has been an important research stream in
   the information systems (IS) sourcing literature. The existing research,
   which was based on the context of implementing centralized enterprise
   systems, focused on the adoption of deliberate learning and implicit
   learning, with the assumption that effective selection between these two
   learning approaches is sufficient for service providers to acquire
   vendor capabilities. However, this assumption may not hold in
   implementing a decentralized system based on enterprise blockchain.
   Because an enterprise blockchain system affords a new way of governing
   transactions and demands a new governance mode, it creates an uncertain
   and complex landscape in which the mere selection between deliberate
   learning and implicit learning becomes insufficient. Addressing this gap
   is crucial because many enterprise blockchain projects fail due to the
   incompetence of service providers. By conducting an in-depth case study
   of a successful blockchain service provider, our study reveals a new
   mechanism for developing vendor capabilities: parallel play. As with
   parallel play by preschoolers, the service provider combines a set of
   learning approaches featuring borrowing from peers and learning through
   experimentation. Our study extends the IS sourcing literature on vendor
   capabilities development from the context of implementing centralized
   enterprise systems to the context of implementing decentralized
   enterprise blockchain systems. Our findings also provide guidelines for
   blockchain service providers to follow when acquiring vendor
   capabilities and for clients to use when selecting service providers.},

	abstract = {In the digital economy era, cloud-edge collaboration technology provides
   the necessary technical support for the digital transformation of
   enterprises, which can improve the quality of services (QoS), and it
   attracts extensive attention from scholars and entrepreneurs from all
   fields. Under the bounded-rationality hypothesis, this paper
   investigates the service mechanism for the cloud-edge collaboration
   system considering the quality of experience (QoE) and presents a
   dynamic evolutionary game model between cloud service providers and edge
   operators by applying the evolutionary game theory. Then, this paper
   analyzes the equilibrium and stability conditions for the
   decision-making of both parties involved to guarantee the QoE reaches
   the ideal state. In addition, we investigate the factors that influence
   the stable cooperation between the two evolutionary stable strategies
   and validate the theoretical analytical results with numerical
   simulations. The research results show that the final evolution of the
   cloud-edge collaboration system depends on the benefits and costs of the
   game matrix between the two parties and the initial state values of the
   system. Under a specific condition, the cloud-edge collaboration system
   can eventually be driven to be an ideal state by reducing the
   collaboration cost and improving the collaboration benefit. The more
   both parties focus on the QoE, the more conducive it will be for the
   formation of a cloud-edge collaboration, thus effectively promoting
   long-term stability and better serving enterprises' digital

	abstract = {Checking account providers must understand the importance of digital and
   non-digital service attributes across different customer segments to
   achieve a product-market fit in digitalization. In particular, various
   latent personal characteristics influence customer choices in digital
   banking. However, there is only limited research on banking customer
   behavior beyond the technology acceptance model, and none that explores
   customer preferences for checking accounts experimentally. Against this
   background, we present the results of a discrete choice experiment on
   customer preferences towards checking accounts in Germany. The outcome
   of the paper is a detailed quantitative assessment of the relationships
   between checking account service attributes and a set of latent
   influencing factors on choice. While customer service experience, the
   scope of services, and professional expertise are identified as
   re-occurring critical aspects for customers when choosing their banking
   service provider, the type of provider and digital product innovation
   showed little impact on customer choice overall. In multigroup analyses,
   we reveal the moderating impact of influencing factors on the preference
   of checking account service attributes. Additional segmentation analyses
   point to six customer segments from which four still prefer a
   traditional operating model. The largest segment of traditional
   product-innovative customers prefers digitalized, i.e., data-driven
   checking accounts in a mixed-mode with human customer advisory and
   on-site branch services from a traditional bank. At the other end of the
   spectrum, a small innovative Fintech customer segment, influenced by
   non-pragmatism and social norms, prefers a purely digital operating
   model with data-driven applications in banking.},

   digital enterprises to create competitive advantage and ensure corporate
   survival. However, many organisations do not realise that successful
   digital transformation (DT) requires much more than technology; it can
   only succeed if they manage their data, information and knowledge as

   conducted by academic and industry partners, a mutually beneficial
   journey spanning the past ten years. The aim was to develop a Holistic
   Information Asset Management (HIAM) model indicating the important areas
   of information asset management (IAM) that support the DT journey.
   Interviews were conducted with C-level executives in organisations from
   all industries on three continents to investigate their IAM practices,
   the barriers to good IAM and the benefits of managing information assets
   (IAs) well. This paper proposes that organisations should focus on ten
   domains in their quest for effective IAM: i) business benefits, ii)

	abstract = {As Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) infrastructure expands and
   more satellites are launched, the number of signals and measurements
   available to users increases, resulting in a corresponding rise in data
   generation rates. GNSS receivers with the ability to process triple
   frequency measurements and multi-constellation reception, have been
   complemented with the massive deployment of connected, GNSS-enabled
   devices such as smartphones, wearables, and IoT sensors, triggering the
   growth of a highly dispersed cloud of GNSS data. This trend observed in
   other domains presents both challenges and opportunities for
   applications of GNSS technology. The scientific exploitation of GNSS
   data involves developing new concepts through the analysis of the
   aforementioned sources of information. Traditionally, the extraction of
   insights from GNSS data has relied on searching and downloading datasets
   from multiple repositories. These datasets provided by numerous
   organisations are scattered worldwide, containing gems of information
   difficult to track and discover. This approach hinders research
   productivity, as scientists are forced to shift their focus from data
   exploration, analysis, modelling, visualization, and realisation of
   conclusions to a long list of repetitive and manual tasks of little
   added value. The GNSS Science Support Centre (GSSC) hosts ESA's
   innovative Digital Platform for GNSS, GSSC Now, which integrates a large
   GNSS repository with cutting-edge features for data exploration and
   analysis. The paper presents key functionalities of GSSC Now and
   highlights its value through case studies of real-world GNSS
   applications. This platform expands established computational limits,
   placing the data source side-by-side with cloud computing capabilities.
   The change of paradigm provides scientists with seamless execution of
   Machine Learning models, interactive algorithms and visualisation tools
   on a vast repository of GNSS data, removing barriers that hinder
   research productivity. (c) 2024 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. This

	abstract = {The UK Government's Building Information Modelling (BIM) mandate has
   encouraged the utilisation of BIM within the Transportation Sector (TS),

   processes are incipient to TS project implementation across the UK. This
   paper is carried out to understand the current BIM usage within the UK's
   TS and how BIM practises and workflows contribute towards the
   government's NZC approach. We used research questions derived from the
   population, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) system and
   inclusion and exclusion criteria to screen irrelevant information from a
   Systematic Literature review with 18 pieces of literature. We identified
   six key drivers: carbon reduction and BIM, BIM in transportation design,
   BIM uptake and usage in transportation, BIM in transportation
   construction and Digital Twins and BIM. It was identified that, with the
   integration of the Carbon Calculator Tool into Civil 3D, structural and
   material data can be obtained and areas of Embodied Carbon hotspots can
   be identified to contribute to reduce overall carbon across a project,
   which requires further collaboration between software providers and
   industry leaders for further streamlining the process. A limitation of
   this research is the requirement for wider study of differing
   disciplines within the TS, more qualitative research and a lack of
   information regarding other Carbon Calculator Tools and how compatible
   they are with Civil 3D.},

	abstract = {Background: This study investigates the potential of digital
   construction to enhance the planning competence of project managers in
   dealing with the complexities of mega construction projects. Traditional
   project strategies often struggle to adapt in dynamic situations,
   particularly evident in mega construction endeavours. Drawing
   inspiration from successful digital strategies in manufacturing, this
   research proposes that adopting digital techniques could bolster project
   managers' ability to navigate complexity during construction, leading to
   improved infrastructure delivery within budget and on schedule. Methods:
   Employing a quantitative approach, this study utilized an online
   questionnaire to gather insights from project managers. The proposed
   hypothesis was assessed using a one-sample t-test. Additionally,
   Pearson's correlation coefficient was employed to gauge the strength of
   the relationship between various constructs. This approach aimed to
   determine the extent to which digital construction can support effective
   complexity management during mega construction projects. Results: The
   results indicate that digital construction equips project managers with
   enhanced capabilities to efficiently coordinate and allocate resources
   in real-time within complex construction environments, thereby
   optimizing overall project performance. Despite these advantages, the
   findings also reveal that managers continue to encounter challenges
   overseeing numerous participants during infrastructure construction.
   This suggests that while digital construction contributes to improved
   planning against complexity, addressing the management of multiple
   stakeholders remains an ongoing challenge. Conclusions: This study
   presents a novel contribution to the construction industry by
   demonstrating the potential of synergizing various digital tools
   throughout construction processes to empower project managers in
   effectively addressing the complexities inherent in mega construction
   planning. Furthermore, it underscores how digital construction confers a
   dynamic advantage for project managers in navigating complexities and
   enhancing overall project performance.},

	abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the tension in brand
   management created through the rapid transformation of social media,
   mapping the maintenance of increasingly complex B2B relationship
   dynamics with key intermediaries. Design/methodology/approachIn-depth
   interviews with 17 social media practitioners from leading fashion
   brands, agencies and platforms in the UK and Australia informed this
   study. Analysis used grounded theory, and results were interpreted
   through the lens of network and stakeholder theories. FindingsSocial
   media platforms have evolved into critical brand stakeholders, serving
   as gatekeepers in an increasingly unbalanced system between provider and
   marketer. The perpetuation of a hierarchical power dynamic affects the
   development of both practitioner and firm capabilities with negative
   implications and consequences for organisational control of branded
   social media communications. Three theoretical propositions are offered
   relating to the nature of platform hegemony, the notion of social media
   democratisation and the limiting impact of rapid change on the formation
   of relational ties. Originality/valueThis study extends the
   conceptualisation of communal custody of brands in social media settings
   to incorporate a growing number of commercial stakeholders, challenging
   the traditional dyadic consumer-brand relational paradigm. This study
   sheds new light on the impact of digital transformation on power
   distributions in social media communities not hitherto addressed.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the unbundling of research in the context of the
   Teachers' Research Exchange (T-REX) platform, the national flagship
   Internet platform in Ireland for teachers to access, use and engage in
   research. This paper draws on two theoretical frameworks: Laurillard's
   conversational framework and Salmon's five-stage model. The first
   highlights the experimental, exploratory and creative aspects of
   developing an overall framework to structure the digital learning
   environment for teachers-as-researchers. The second explores the future
   of higher education and systems like T-REX in the era of digital
   transformation and the emerging context of Education 4.0. The original
   contribution is the integration of these frameworks in the creation of
   an open and shared learning platform so that schools and teachers can be
   supported to access, collaborate in and undertake research. In
   particular, the paper outlines signature features of the T-REX design
   and the way it has emerged over the last 5 years as an innovative
   platform to mediate the fusion of research and teaching in education.
   The paper highlights key issues and challenges in unbundling the
   traditional university, particularly in the context of educational
   research, but also the imperative of doing so, in the emerging era of
   Education 4.0.
   Implications for practice or policy:
   Supporting teachers' research engagement is increasingly identified as a
   key priority in the improvement of educational standards and systems.
   T-REX is of value to educationalists interested in a shared learning and
   open online teacher-research platform.
   There should be a dialogic approach to the relationship between teaching
   and research, where each informs and enhances the other.},

   engagement. This study focuses on identifying the strategies used by
   digital libraries to engage with users and enhance their satisfaction.
   Adopting a qualitative research design, the data was collected through
   ten semi-structured interviews with IT staff members and system
   librarians from three digital academic libraries in China. The sample
   was identified with purposive sampling technique. The collected data was
   thematically analyzed to retrieve the underpinning themes. These themes
   explained the situation of contemporary digital libraries in China. The
   findings indicate that managing a large digital database can be
   challenging due to several security breach concerns. However, the IT
   staff of these libraries ensure regular system upgrades. Libraries also
   invite user feedback to strengthen their services. This study also
   presents some suggestions to provide better services to users. These
   suggestions include using a user-centric interface, providing

	abstract = {In recent years, the manufacturing sector is going through a major
   transformation, as reflected in the concept of Industry 4.0 and digital
   transformation. The urge for such transformation is intensified when we
   consider the growing societal demands for sustainability. The notion of
   sustainable manufacturing has emerged as a result of this trend.
   Additionally, industries and the whole society face the challenges of an
   increasing number of disruptive events, either natural or human-caused,
   that can severely affect the normal operation of systems. Furthermore,
   the growing interconnectivity between organizations, people, and
   physical systems, supported by recent developments in information and
   communication technologies, highlights the important role that
   collaborative networks can play in the digital transformation processes.
   As such, this article analyses potential synergies between the areas of
   sustainable and resilient manufacturing and collaborative networks. The
   work also discusses how the responsibility for the various facets of
   sustainability can be distributed among the multiple entities involved
   in manufacturing. The study is based on a literature survey,
   complemented with the experience gained from various research projects
   and related initiatives in the area, and is organized according to
   various dimensions of Industry 4.0. A brief review of proposed
   approaches and indicators for measuring sustainability from the
   networked manufacturing perspective is also included. Finally, a set of
   key research challenges are identified to complement strategic research
   agendas in manufacturing.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and
   artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent applications in various
   fields, such as intelligent manufacturing, have been prioritized. The
   most important issue in intelligent manufacturing is to maintain a high
   utilization rate of production. On the one hand, for maintaining high
   utilization, the production line must have enough materials at any time;
   on the other hand, too many materials in stock would greatly increase
   the operating cost of the factory. Therefore, maintaining sufficient
   inventory while avoiding excessive inventory is an important key issue
   in intelligent manufacturing. After the factory receives the order, it
   would issue the manufacturing order to the production line for
   manufacturing. The capacities of different production lines are
   different. If the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   system based on the IoT framework can be used to monitor the capacity of
   each production line, in addition to estimating the capacity, the usage
   of key materials can also be accurately estimated through AI; when the
   quantity of key materials is below the safety stock, the manufacturer
   can actively notify the supplier and request for replenishment. This is
   a Customer-to-Business (C2B) safety stock management model (i.e., the
   vendor-managed inventory, VMI), which combines AI and IoT. In
   particular, in the case of consumer electronics, because their life
   cycles are short and they are vulnerable to market fluctuations, the
   manufacturer must adjust the production capacity. This study will
   propose to construct a SCADA system based on the IoT, including the
   capacity of the production line, materials inventory, and downstream
   order requirements, and use the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to
   accurately predict inventory requirements. In this study, through the
   factory, a SCADA system based on AI and IoT will be constructed to
   monitor the factory's manufacturing capacity and predict the product
   sales of downstream manufacturers, for the purpose of facilitating the
   analysis and decision-making of safety stock. In addition to effectively
   reducing the inventory level, in essence, the purpose of this study is
   to enhance the competitiveness of the overall production and sales
   ecosystem, and to achieve the goal of digital transformation of
   manufacturing with AI and IoT.},

	abstract = {In this article, we argue that current digital health strategies across
   Canada do not appropriately consider the implications of digital
   technologies (DTs) for public health functions because they adopt a
   primarily clinical focus. We highlight differences between clinical
   medicine and public health, suggesting that conceptualizing digital
   public health (DPH) as a field distinct from, but related to, digital
   health is essential for the development of DTs in public health.
   Focussing on DPH may allow for DTs that deeply consider fundamental
   public health principles of health equity, social justice and action on
   the social and ecological determinants of health. Moreover, the digital
   transformation of health services catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic and
   changing public expectations about the speed and convenience of public
   health services necessitate a specific DPH focus. This imperative is
   reinforced by the need to address the growing role of DTs as
   determinants of health that influence health behaviours and outcomes.
   Making the distinction between DPH and digital health will require more
   specific DPH strategies that are aligned with emergent digital
   strategies across Canada, development of intersectoral transdisciplinary
   partnerships and updated competencies of the public health workforce to
   ensure that DTs in public health can improve health outcomes for all
   Canadians.},

   balance stakeholder interests, ensure reasonable profits for the digital
   company and social organization, and reduce participation costs through
   grassroots mobilization, data support, and subsidies for digital

	abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to explore the perceptions of supply chain
   managers regarding the elements that make up cyber supply chain risk
   management (CSCRM) and the related level of alignment, to understand how
   organizations can deploy a CSCRM strategy that goes beyond the
   technical, internal functioning of single companies and moves beyond the
   dyad, to create a better alignment that can ultimately lead to improved
   cyber supply chain resilience.
   Design/methodology/approach
   An exploratory survey in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry
   involving over 100 organizations in Italy was conducted. Results were
   analysed through one-way analysis of variance, to appraise the
   differences in the perceptions of the various actors of the FMCG supply
   chain (Manufacturers, Logistics Service Providers, Retailers).
   Findings
   While a certain degree of alignment of the perceptions across the FMCG
   supply chain exists, the study found that Logistics Service Providers
   can play a crucial role as orchestrators of the CSCRM process towards a
   more ``supply chain-oriented{''} response to cyber threats and risk
   events. The research also highlights the necessity to see people as key
   elements for improving cyber resilience in the supply chain.
   Research limitations/implications
   Through a vertical analysis of a supply chain, the study extends the
   existing theory on CSCRM, which contains isolated case studies. It also
   contributes to extending the current theory with the proposal of the
   paradigm of Logistics Service Providers as orchestrators of the CSCRM
   process. The study combines different classifications of CSCRM
   initiatives and embraces theories external to the supply chain
   literature.
   Practical implications
   Through the empirical analysis, this study helps practitioners in
   streamlining the design of cyber security strategies and actions that
   span across the supply chain for better alignment. This could mean more
   coordination of efforts and more targeted/accurate investments in CSCRM
   initiatives. The study invites practitioners to ponder the perceived
   relevance of the human factor as a source of risk and the perceived
   importance of countermeasures aimed at mitigating risk events stemming
   from that source.
   Originality/value
   By focusing on an entire supply chain, this is one of the first studies
   on CSCRM that goes beyond the dyad. Its originality also lies in its use
   of the investigations of perceptions along the supply chain as pillars
   for the alignment of CSCRM strategies and mitigation initiatives. This
   original perspective allows for discovering the role of Logistics
   Service Providers in driving the alignment of the efforts towards better
   outcomes of the CSCRM process.},

	abstract = {As GovTech solutions are steadily entering the public sector, they have
   yet to find their way into the mainstream literature. GovTech refers to
   socio-technical solutions - that are developed and operated by private
   organisations - intertwined with public sector components for
   facilitating processes in the public sector. GovTech solutions promise a
   superior customer journey for citizens and businesses compared to
   current government portals and front desks. GovTech solutions can be a
   blessing in disguise for governments struggling in their digital
   transformation journey, carrying the burden of public service innovation
   and replacing legacy systems with modern GovTech solutions. Yet, there
   are also concerns that GovTech solutions are a Trojan horse, exploiting
   the lack of technical knowledge at public agencies and shifting
   decision-making power from public agencies to market parties, thereby
   undermining digital sovereignty and public values. This paper develops a
   research agenda for GovTech based on a conceptual framework. This
   framework reveals four interrelated design areas for GovTech:
   institutional, governance, technical and human-centred design.
   Governments can employ the conceptual framework to further align and
   develop their strategies by focussing on GovTech governance, referring
   to the ability to manage the various interdependencies between the four
   design areas.},

	abstract = {Despite interest in opportunities that Industry 4.0 offers for Supply
   Chain Resilience (SCR), little is known about the underlying mechanisms
   for such contributions. The study develops a roadmap that explains how
   supply chains can capitalize on Industry 4.0 SCR functions. The study
   conducted a content-centric literature review and identified 16
   functions through which Industry 4.0 enhances SCR. Results reveal that
   the Industry 4.0 SCR functions identified are highly interrelated, and
   supply chain members should align their digitalization strategies with
   the sequence in which Industry 4.0 delivers these functions. Industry
   4.0 contribution to SCR first involves delivering data-centric functions
   such as supply chain automation, information and communication quality,
   process monitoring, and visibility. Industry 4.0 further allows supply
   chain partners to collaborate better on improving supply chain mapping,
   complexity management, and innovation capabilities. Through these
   functions and by increasing transparency, flexibility, and agility of
   supply chain operations, Industry 4.0 delivers more dependent but
   consequential resilience functions such as supply chain responsiveness,
   adaptive capability, and continuity management. The roadmap further
   explains how each pair of Industry 4.0 SCR functions mutually interact
   while contributing to the overall resilience of the supply chain. The
   study discusses possible implications and outlines important avenues for
   future research.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the
   pilot implementation of an industry-specific web portal as an IT
   resource on textile SMEs organisational performance. Using a
   resource-based perspective, portal delivery functionalities, considered
   as non-physical IT resources, are analysed using the dimensions of
   portal usefulness, portal interface, and service-oriented portal
   functions on SMEs users' perceived outcomes of organisational
   performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative and quantitative approaches
   are used to explore the research hypotheses. Data were collected using
   field interviews and survey from senior executives of small-and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Taiwanese textile industry.
   Findings - Results indicate that the service-oriented portal function
   dimension, consisting of portal maintenance service, B2B function, and
   cloud computing, significantly influences organisational performance.
   Unexpected findings, such as the negative impact of greater industry
   benchmark information on perceived SME performance, deserve further
   investigation.
   Research limitations/implications - The study extends the theory and
   knowledge on the resource-based view and its implications on e-business
   organisational performance of SMEs. The study also offers findings
   relevant to the design of portal sites for SME administrators and
   information service providers. Limitations of the research include a
   small size and the industry-specific data limiting the generalisability
   of the findings.
   Practical implications - Research results practically serve as
   informative indicators for policy makers, information service providers,
   and SMEs executives to evaluate feasible elements for web portal design
   in traditional industry. Findings from this study may help portal
   service providers in designing better web portal functionalities for
   SMEs.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the IT business value
   literature by identifying the linkages between industry-specific portal
   delivery functionalities and perceived organisational performance
   through the examination of portal usefulness, portal interface, and
   service-oriented portal function for textile SMEs.},

	abstract = {The development process in the coatings industry can be shortened by
   digital transformation, and its costs can be reduced using a technical
   enabler. However, formulators need up-to-date and comprehensive data on
   existing and potential ingredients to develop the formulation. We were
   curious about how to supply formulators with data. The idea was that
   suppliers of ingredients provide data using the ``common enabling
   technology{''}. We hypothesize that direct data entry compensates
   suppliers because they can shorten the sales process and increase sales.
   We used a survey to select key sales channels in the industry. Detailed
   process models were designed using structured interviews. We analyzed
   models using structural and operational indicators. Finally, we formed a
   new digital sales process and verified it. The results show that the
   digitally formatted sales process can be shortened by up to 32\%.
   Simultaneously, more potential customers can be accessed using the
   common technology. Existing sales channels would not be closed down.
   Nevertheless, the digital sales channel is expected to prove its worth
   over time and gradually increase its share. The suppliers of ingredients
   can thus avoid a radical process transformation and the immediate
   integration of additional information technology into the company
   information system in such an evolutionary way.},

	abstract = {Digital inclusion is a critical component of sustainable e-government,
   ensuring equitable access to digital public services for all citizens.
   However, challenges such as limited digital literacy, infrastructural
   gaps, and institutional barriers hinder widespread adoption,
   particularly among marginalized populations. This study examines the key
   obstacles to digital inclusion in e-government and explores
   technology-driven and policy-based solutions. A qualitative approach was
   employed, integrating case studies from developed and developing nations
   to assess best practices and localized policy adaptations. The findings
   highlight that public-private partnerships, digital literacy programs,
   and the integration of emerging technologies-such as artificial
   intelligence (AI), blockchain, and cloud computing-play a crucial role
   in enhancing accessibility and security. Additionally, aligning digital
   inclusion policies with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs), particularly SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 9 (Industry,
   Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG
   16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), strengthens the long-term
   impact of digital governance. This study emphasizes the need for
   governments to adopt an inclusive, multi-stakeholder approach to
   e-government implementation, ensuring long-term investments in
   accessibility, cybersecurity, and user trust. Future research should
   explore mixed-method approaches and comparative analyses across
   different socio-economic contexts to refine strategies for digital

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) provides a diverse platform to automate things
   where smart agriculture is one of the most promising concepts in the
   field of Internet of Agriculture Things (IoAT). Due to the requirements
   of more processing power for computations and predictions, the concept
   of Cloud-based smart agriculture is proposed for autonomic systems. This
   is where digital innovation and technology helps to improve the quality
   of life in the area of urbanization expansion. For the integration of
   cloud in smart agriculture, the system is shown to have security and
   privacy challenges, and most significantly, the identification of
   malicious and compromised nodes along with a secure transmission of
   information between sensors, cloud, and base station (BS). The
   identification of malicious and compromised node among soil sensors
   communicating with the BS is a notable challenge in the BS to cloud
   communications. The trust management mechanism is proposed as one of the
   solutions providing a lightweight approach to identify these nodes. In
   this article, we have proposed a novel trust management mechanism to
   identify malicious and compromised nodes by utilizing trust parameters.
   The trust mechanism is an event-driven process that computes trust based
   on the pre-defined time interval and utilizes the previous trust degree
   to develop an absolute trust degree. The system also maintains the trust
   degree of a BS and cloud service providers using distinct approaches. We
   have also performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of
   the proposed mechanism against several potential attacks. In addition,
   this research helps to create friendlier environments and efficient
   agricultural productions for the migration of people to the cities.},

   Examining a broad range of documents by professional associations,

   four main competing visions: industrialized automated construction that
   promises increased productivity, efficiency and competitiveness;
   data-based integration that promises partnership and collaboration;
   digitally enabled, singularized architecture, where the logic of the
   unique is given precedence over the logic of the generic; and
   sustainable construction, where computerbased-technologies ensure the

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how 3D digital technology
   can bring value to the fashion industry by analysing the specific
   benefits it offers along the value chain. Additionally, the authors show
   some of the challenges ahead identified for both software and fashion
   firms.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors present by means of a case
   study the experience of an haute couture designer who used 3D digital
   technology-in collaboration with a recognised 3D software company-for
   developing his first luxury footwear collection.
   Findings - The enhancement of creativity and a better communication with
   suppliers are just some of the benefits identified in the case study
   from the use of 3D digital technology. In addition, challenges such as
   the development of a digital culture or the need for technology
   simplification are drawn from the case.
   Practical implications - Apart from the benefits and challenges drawn
   from the case study, which can be useful to practitioners in this
   industry, the authors also identify the collaboration through which the
   experience took place as an interesting practice to implement as a
   previous step of a digital transformation strategy.
   Originality/value - Despite the growing interest the fashion industry is
   showing in the use of new digital technologies, academic research on
   this topic is still scarce. Therefore, the case study presented in this
   paper adds value to the literature showing how 3D technology can help
   fashion from concept to consumer.},

	abstract = {Filling the gaps between virtual and physical systems will open new
   doors in Smart Manufacturing. This work proposes a data-driven approach
   to utilize digital transformation methods to automate smart
   manufacturing systems. This is fundamentally enabled by using a digital
   twin to represent manufacturing cells, simulate system behaviors,
   predict process faults, and adaptively control manipulated variables.
   First, the manufacturing cell is accommodated to environments such as
   computer-aided applications, industrial Product Lifecycle Management
   solutions, and control platforms for automation systems. Second, a
   network of interfaces between the environ-ments is designed and
   implemented to enable communication between the digital world and
   physical manufacturing plant, so that near-synchronous controls can be
   achieved. Third, capabilities of some members in the family of Deep
   Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are discussed with manufacturing features
   within the context of Smart Manufacturing. Trained results for Deep Q
   Learning algorithms are finally presented in this work as a case study
   to incorporate DRL-based artificial intelligence to the industrial
   control process. As a result, developed control methodology, named
   Digital Engine, is expected to acquire process knowledges, schedule
   manufacturing tasks, identify optimal actions, and demonstrate control
   robustness. The authors show that integrating a smart agent into the
   industrial platforms further expands the usage of the system-level
   digital twin, where intelligent control algorithms are trained and
   verified upfront before deployed to the physical world for
   implementation. Moreover, DRL approach to automated manufacturing
   control problems under facile optimization environments will be a novel
   combination between data science and manufacturing industries.},

   curriculum for tourism studies at a Spanish university, responding to
   industry needs for broader, high-level knowledge and skills, with a
   strong emphasis on sustainability, digital transformation, and socially
   responsible practices. The curriculum prioritizes critical and strategic
   thinking alongside liberal reflection to empower students to lead in
   sustainable tourism development. Developed collaboratively with the
   entire tourism faculty, the curriculum design was informed by an
   extensive analysis of 105 international university courses, 204 job
   offers, feedback from 195 alumni, and ongoing consultations with
   professionals and community partners. Grounded in the concept of
   curriculum space and the philosophic practitioner framework, the
   curriculum integrates knowledge, soft skills, and attitudes to foster an
   innovative, sustainable learning ecosystem that prepares graduates to

	abstract = {Research on open innovation (OI) in SMEs, particularly in the context of
   digital innovations and big data (BD), often highlights the potential
   for these innovations to drive SME growth. While digital innovations and
   BD can indeed enhance OI practices by presenting new opportunities,
   there is a significant gap in understanding how the challenges posed by
   these innovations can also act as catalysts for OI in SMEs. This study
   addresses this gap by examining the challenges faced by SMEs when
   leveraging digital innovations and BD for service delivery in the
   agri-food sector, and how they address them through OI practices.
   Focusing on Agritech firms in Ghana's agri-food sector as an empirical
   case, we conducted qualitative exploratory research using interviews and
   secondary data to fill the research gap. Our findings showcase how
   Agritech firms adopt OI practices through strategic collaborations and
   partnerships with external organizations interested in agricultural
   interventions which was triggered by the challenges they faced in
   leveraging digital innovations and BD. These partnerships and
   collaborations also serve as anticipatory measures to tackle potential
   future challenges. Our findings are not only applicable to Agritech
   firms in the agri-food sector but also offer valuable insights for other
   SMEs with limited financial resources and portfolio diversification in
   other sectors for anticipating related challenges.},

	abstract = {The ongoing quest for the tight integration of network operation and the
   network service provisioning initiated with the introduction of 5G often
   clashes with the capacity of current network architectures to provide
   means for such integration. Owing to the traditional design of mobile
   networks, which barely required a tight interaction, network elements
   offer capabilities for their continuous optimization just within their
   domain (eg, access, or core), allowing for a ``silo-style{''} automation
   that falls short when aiming at closed-loop automation that embraces all
   the actors involved in the network, from network functions up to the
   service-provider network functions. To this end, in this article, we
   make the case for the network-wide capability exposure framework for
   closed-loop automation by (i) defining the different entities that shall
   expose capabilities, and (ii) discussing why the state of the art
   solutions are not enough to support this vision. Our proposed
   architecture, which relies on registration and discovery, and exposure
   functions, allows for enhanced use cases that are currently not possible
   with state of the art solution. We prove the feasibility of our solution
   by implementing it in a real-world testbed, employing Artificial
   Intelligence algorithms to close the loop for the management of the

   among different players in the food industry, such as farmers, food
   suppliers and investors, enabling an effective decision-making process
   where the information about goods is traceable without any inherent
   risk. Although blockchain technology is emerging, its use in the food
   industry needs to be explored from different angles, such as
   organizations' policy, adoption strategies and potential technology
   innovations which could positively impact business processes.
   Design/methodology/approach For this purpose, the authors survey 84
   organizations in the food industry. Further, the authors conducted
   in-depth- interviews with three organizations that applied blockchain
   technology in the production phase to address the pros and cons of this
   adaption and discuss how the technology could be improved based on the
   challenges they faced. Moreover, an overview of current and potential
   digital transformation uses cases of blockchain technology in the food
   industry has been provided. Findings The results suggested that
   perceived efficiency, transparency, standardization and platform
   development and traceability factors positively influenced intention to
   use (ITU). Practical implications The adoption of the blockchain cloud
   solution is neither time-consuming nor expensive; organizations may
   attempt to predict how regulations or standards will be developed to
   create a blockchain solution compatible with them. Originality/value

   concept in the discussion about what kinds of skills managers need for
   digital transformation. The main research question our study explored
   was if digital leadership is associated with psychological well-being in
   upper-level managers. Based on a qualitative pilot study and relevant
   literature, we developed a new scale for digital leadership in managers.
   We conducted an online survey with a sample of 368 upper-level managers
   from a large German ICT-company. Using a stepwise logistic regression
   analysis, potential effects of digital leadership on psychological
   well-being (WHO-5) were analysed. Logistic regression analyses showed
   that better skills in digital leadership were significantly associated
   with higher well-being. Results also showed that gender, age and
   managerial experience had no effect in our model. Our study provides a
   valuable insight into the association between digital leadership and
   well-being in managers. However, further research is necessary to
   validate the newly developed scale for digital leadership and to confirm
   a causal effect in the relationship between digital leadership and
   well-being.},

	abstract = {This study explores the potential of AI to enable circular business
   model innovation (CBMI) for industrial manufacturers and the
   corresponding AI capacities and dynamic capabilities required for their
   commercialization. Employing an analysis of six leading B2B firms
   engaged in digital servitization, we conceptualize the perceptive,
   predictive, and prescriptive capacities of AI, which enhance resource
   efficiency by automating and augmenting data-driven analysis and
   decision making. We further identify two innovative classes of
   AI-enabled CBMs - augmentation (e.g., optimization solutions) and
   automation (e.g., autonomous solutions) business models - and their main
   circular value drivers. Finally, our research reveals novel dynamic
   capabilities underpinning the innovation of AI-enabled business models -
   value discovery, value realization, and value optimization capabilities
   - which enable manufacturers to make economic and sustainable values
   come to life in collaborating with customers and ecosystem partners.
   This study represents an important step in our understanding of how AI
   can drive circularity and sustainable innovation in industrial digital
   servitization. Overall, our study contributes to practice and the
   academic literature on AI, circular business models, and digital
   servitization by highlighting the potential of AI to empower CBMs for

	abstract = {Driven by the servicing and digital transformation of manufacturing
   enterprises, product and service innovation for manufacturers and
   service providers to promote integrated solutions collaboratively has
   become an important way for enterprises to maintain market
   competitiveness. Building on this foundation, this paper develops an
   innovation priority decision model for the product-service supply chain,
   which comprises manufacturers and service providers, considering the
   data mining and information sharing strategies of service providers. It
   analyzes the optimal decisions and profits of the members when product
   innovation is prioritized as well as when service innovation is
   prioritized, and subsequently explores the selection of innovation
   strategies for the product-service supply chain under varying
   conditions. The results of the study show that, firstly, service
   providers' data mining and information sharing strategies are not always
   favorable to the innovation decisions of both parties. Only when data
   resources can be transformed into real innovation value at a reasonable
   cost can data mining and information sharing play the role of `external
   incentives' to promote collaborative innovation between the two parties.
   Secondly, when service providers do not adopt data mining and
   information sharing strategies, the efficiency of product and service
   innovation plays a decisive role in innovation prioritization. The party
   with high innovation efficiency adopts the sub-priority innovation
   strategy, which can lead to a larger market share for the innovation
   results. Finally, under the service provider's data mining and
   information sharing strategy, the innovation priority selection of the
   product-service supply chain depends on the information value
   transformation ability of the manufacturer and the service provider.
   Moreover, the profits of manufacturers and service providers under the
   same innovation priority do not always `advance or retreat together',
   and there may be cases where one of them suffers a loss of profits. This
   study provides a theoretical basis for the choice of innovation
   strategies given to manufacturers and service providers, and promotes
   the development of collaborative innovation between them.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly strained online food delivery
   services (OFDS) globally. This has challenged OFDS businesses to
   redesign and deploy technologies to meet customer demand. The purpose of
   this article is to identify the optimal factors contributing to customer
   experience with OFDS services during a black swan event such as the
   COVID-19 pandemic. We followed a four-step research design to identify
   the optimal factors for OFDS. First, we identified the major episodes in
   the OFDS process. Second, these episodes were evaluated by customers
   using the sequential incidence technique. Third, we used an orthogonal
   design to analyze the episodes at different levels based on customer
   preferences. Finally, we used the Taguchi approach to calculate the
   signal-to-noise ratios and identify the optimal factors and their
   preferred levels. We classify the optimal factors into customer-oriented
   and service-provider-oriented propositions. The option to select the
   delivery person and delivery conditions was found to be the most optimal
   customer-oriented attribute. We discuss the theoretical and managerial
   implications of the study and suggest major avenues for digital
   transformations in OFDS for better customer experience.},

	abstract = {Many companies in the construction industry have recently expressed a
   particular interest in undertaking digital transformation by adopting
   new technologies in an attempt to increase productivity and quality. In
   responding to this new reality, these companies, particularly small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), face multiple challenges. Software
   vendors have recently been developing a large range of digital
   solutions, such as project planning and control software. Nevertheless,
   target companies are not generally guided in their choices and cannot
   find the support they need. The delays seen in these companies' adoption
   of new technologies can be attributed squarely to a lack of references
   allowing them to understand their real needs and manage the main
   challenges they face. The project reported in this article was carried
   out with an industry partner specializing in construction mechanics. The
   first step was to understand and characterize the partner's current
   project planning and control processes. Then, different information
   technology (IT) solutions were compared through a number of criteria
   defined with the company in order to choose the most appropriate
   software solution. Finally, new processes were proposed, and a prototype
   was developed and validated with the company in order to ensure the
   effectiveness of proposed changes. Using research action methods, the
   research brings a new perspective on the needs of specialized
   contractors, highlighting the challenges related to the characterization
   of the needs due to the difference of perspective of the different
   practitioners in the company. It also showed how it is important to
   define new processes to map the complementarity between the selected
   tools and the existing ones. The research finally highlighted the
   importance of an active involvement of the practitioners in order to
   validate the proposals and avoid resistance to change.},

	abstract = {In today's dynamic business environment, agile supply chain (ASC) has
   become a key strategic move to cope with market instability, handle
   competitive pressures and strengthen operational and organizational
   performance. Meanwhile ASC is a good example of a strategy drawing
   heavily on digitization since as a demand chain management it was
   information-centric and technology-centric from its inception. Yet,
   despite this relationship, a lack of coherence and clarity around the
   input of technology for ASC has impeded to portray accurately the
   relative importance of digitization in ASC strategies. This study
   provides a comprehensive and integrative review of 90 articles on ASC.
   By so doing, we contribute to the discussion about digitization in the
   supply chain in several ways. First, the paper reports descriptively and
   analytically how technology was addressed within the ASC literature.
   Second, it maps a nomological network of ASC research. Third, it finds
   that technology appears as a necessary but not-sufficient enabling
   factor for ASC deployment. Finally, a research agenda is proposed to
   suggest future research avenues to improve contributions to ASC
   performance.},

	abstract = {Due to the current digital transition, companies are under pressure to
   pursue digitalization and often initiate far-reaching transformation
   processes. As a result, managers must drive change within a company and
   are involved in important decision-making processes. In the present
   study, we focused on two cognitive job demands in managers related to
   change due to digital transformation: perceived choice overload and
   pressure from digitalization. We assumed that the extent of challenging
   cognitive demands at work is rising and negatively influencing managers'
   psychological well-being. We conducted an online survey with a sample of
   368 upper-level managers from a large ICT-company, where, at the time of
   the study, extensive transformation processes were taking place. Using
   multivariate regression analysis, potential prognostic effects on
   well-being were tested. Results showed that lower well-being was
   significantly associated with higher choice overload, but not with
   perceived pressure from digitalization. In our explorative study, we
   investigated two potential job demands in managers that, to our
   knowledge, have not yet been scientifically tested. Given the unsettled
   state of the field, it is important to try to further understand when
   choice overload and pressure from digitalization occur and when these
   may trigger negative health consequences.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of digital technologies can revolutionize
   industrial companies' operations through the procurement and application
   of digital solutions following a logic of digital servitization.
   However, industrial customers must refine their internal processes to
   exploit the potential servitization. In this transition, the procurement
   organization is pivotal in orchestrating relationships between its
   internal functions and supplier's ecosystems. Yet, traditional
   procurement processes are poorly suited to the evaluation and
   procurement of digital servitization offerings, hampering value
   cocreation between suppliers and customers. The purpose of this article
   is to investigate how procurement process models can be adapted to
   address the opportunities and challenges of digital servitization for
   industrial customers. The investigation is based on a case-study design,
   drawing on data collected through in-depth interviews with informants
   from 11 leading customers and 8 global suppliers. Based on the data
   analysis following the Gioia methodology, in this article, we describe
   key challenges with the traditional approach and identify novel
   procurement practices to capture value from digitalization. The
   article's key contribution is to propose a process model for Procurement
   4.0, highlighting four phases: mapping digital opportunities, selecting
   digitalization partners, codeveloping digital solution contracts, and
   promoting continuous digital innovation. Furthermore, we define three
   overarching principles for procurement 4.0: nurture digital ecosystem
   generativity, orchestrate cross-functional integration, and leverage
   supplier capabilities through agile cocreation.},

	abstract = {Engineering education providers should foresee the potential of digital
   transformation of teaching and skill-developing activities so that
   graduating engineers can find themselves highly aligned with the demands
   and attributes needed by prospective industrial employers. The
   advancement of industrial revolutions towards hybridisation of the
   enabling technologies recognised by Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, and
   Industry 5.0 have transformed the components of the engineering higher
   education system remarkably. Future workforce requirements will demand
   an employee's multidisciplinary skill mix and other professional
   qualities. Implementing human-centric decision-making based on insights
   from the Digital Twin (DT) systems, sustainability, and lean systems is
   necessary for further economic growth. Recent barriers identified by the
   Australian Council of Engineering Deans, the development of teaching
   capabilities, and affordable and digitally transformed learning
   facilities by education providers were all considered. This paper
   explores the role of Digital Twins (DTs) in enhancing engineering higher
   education by incorporating Industry 4.0 components and other industrial
   advances. By reviewing curricula, pedagogy, and the evolving skill
   requirements for engineering graduates, this study identifies key
   benefits of DTs, such as cost-effectiveness, resource management, and
   immersive learning experiences. This paper also outlines challenges in
   implementing DT-based labs, including IT infrastructure, data quality,
   privacy, and security issues. The findings indicate that engineering
   education should embrace DTs to foster multidisciplinary skills and
   human-centric decision-making to meet future workforce demands.
   Collaboration with industry is highlighted as a crucial factor in the
   successful transformation of teaching practices and in offering
   real-world experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the adoption
   of DT technologies, demonstrating their utility in minimising
   educational disruptions. While this paper acknowledges the high
   potential of DTs to prepare engineering students for future industry
   demands, it also emphasises the need for professional development among
   educators to ensure effective and balanced implementation.},

	abstract = {In the next decade, further digitalisation of the entire wind energy
   project lifecycle is expected to be a major driver for reducing project
   costs and risks. In this paper, a literature review on the challenges
   related to implementation of digitalisation in the wind energy industry
   is first carried out, showing that there is a strong need for new
   solutions that enable co-innovation within and between organisations.
   Therefore, a new collaboration method based on a digital ecosystem is
   developed and demonstrated. The method is centred around specific
   ``challenges{''}, which are defined by ``challenge providers{''} within
   a topical ``space{''} and made available to participants via a digital
   platform. The data required in order to solve a particular
   ``challenge{''} are provided by the ``challenge providers{''} under the
   confidentiality conditions they specify. The method is demonstrated via
   a case study, the EDP Wind Turbine Fault Detection Challenge. Six
   submitted solutions using diverse approaches are evaluated. Two of the
   solutions perform significantly better than EDP's existing solution in
   terms of Total Prediction Costs (saving up to euro120,000). The digital
   ecosystem is found to be a promising solution for enabling co-innovation
   in wind energy in general, providing a number of tangible benefits for
   both challenge and solution providers.},

	abstract = {The digital technologies introduced in recent years have transformed
   consumption practices, particularly in the tourism industry, which is
   currently struggling to survive during the coronavirus pandemic. The
   objective of this paper is to develop an academic structure to identify
   the impact of business innovation practices on performance and firm
   survival strategies, and to understand what new technologies are being
   used to mitigate the pandemic's impact and to establish innovative
   practices that lead to sustainable business performance. Given the
   dynamic nature of the subject area, both quantitative and qualitative
   approaches have been adopted. Firstly, the paper employs a three-round
   Delphi survey with 15 senior executives of Taiwanese leisure
   tourism-related industries to develop measurement techniques. Secondly,
   based on the Delphi survey's results, the study utilizes document
   analysis of website content and case documents of Asia's leading online
   travel agencies (OTAs) during the pandemic. The results demonstrate that
   the business model of OTAs is to fill the gap in the free travel market
   with live-stream conferences that offer information quality and
   innovation practices that are more flexible, down-to-earth, and content
   marketing-oriented than traditional travel agencies. Furthermore, OTAs
   can strategically and financially ally themselves with suitable partners
   when facing major crises to strengthen their competitive advantage and
   create survival opportunities. Finally, AR/VR, AI, and big data (digital
   transformation) are integrated into daily operations to enhance service
   quality, close information gaps, increase the sense of travel security,
   and promote the decentralization of the travel industry. The research
   has practical implications for travel agency managers and policymakers,
   and the paper concludes by discussing challenges and future directions.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Each year, significant volumes of healthcare data are
   generated through both research and care. Since fundamental digital
   processes cannot function effectively without essential data
   competencies, the challenge lies in enhancing the quality of data
   management by establishing data literacy among professionals in
   outpatient healthcare and research. (2) Methods: Within the DIM.RUHR
   project (Data Competence Center for Interprofessional Use of Health Data
   in the Ruhr Metropolis), a didactic concept for interprofessional data
   literacy education is developed, structured as a learning objectives
   matrix. Initially conceived through a literature review, this concept
   has been continually developed through collaboration with
   interprofessional project partners. The study was conducted between
   February 2023 and June 2024. (3) Results: The foundational structure and
   content of the didactic concept are based on various scientific studies
   related to general data literacy and the outcomes of an interactive
   workshop with project partners. Eight distinct subject areas have been
   developed to encompass the data literacy required in healthcare
   professions: (1) Fundamentals and general concepts, (2) ethical, legal,
   and social considerations, (3) establishing a data culture, (4)
   acquiring data, (5) managing data, (6) analyzing data, (7) interpreting
   data, and (8) deriving actions. Within these, learners' data literacy is
   assessed across the four competency areas: basic, intermediate,
   advanced, and highly specialized. (4) Conclusions: The learning
   objectives matrix is anticipated to serve as a solid foundation for the
   development of teaching and learning modules aimed at enhancing data
   literacy across healthcare professions, enabling them to effectively
   manage data processes while addressing the challenges associated with
   digital transformation.},

	abstract = {The National Health Service (NHS), the health care system of the United
   Kingdom, is one of the largest health care entities in the world and has
   been successfully serving the UK population for decades. The NHS is also
   the fourth-largest employer globally. True to its reputation, some of
   the most modern and technically advanced medical services are available
   in the United Kingdom. However, between the acute, primary, secondary,
   and tertiary care providers of the NHS, there needs to be seamless
   integration and interoperability to provide timely holistic care to
   patients at a national level. Various efforts have been taken and
   programs launched since 2002 to achieve digital transformation in the
   NHS but with partial success rates. As it is important to understand a
   problem before trying to solve it, in this paper, we focus on tools used
   to assess the digital maturity of NHS trusts and organizations.
   Additionally, we aim to present the impact of ongoing transformation
   attempts on secondary services, particularly mental health. This paper
   considered the literature on digital maturity and performed a rapid
   review of currently available tools to measure digital maturity. We have
   performed a multivocal literature review that included white papers and
   web-based documents in addition to peer-reviewed literature. Further,
   the paper also provides a perspective of the ground reality from a
   mental health service provider's point of view. Assessment tools adopted
   from the global market, later modified and tailor-made to suit local
   preferences, are currently being used. However, there is a need for a
   robust framework that assesses status, allows target setting, and tracks
   progress across diverse providers.},

   the significant shift in value creation activities from the clients to
   the service providers, and second by pervasive digital penetration,
   resulting in the emergence of Digital Transformational Outsourcing
   (DTO). Service providers now play a more significant role, making their
   capabilities important. In the new context, service providers require a

   business functions on behalf of their clients while delivering digital
   value propositions.
   We study 26 of the largest global business process outsourcing providers
   to conceptualise and identify six dynamic capabilities of service
   providers salient in the new context, i.e., consultative, orchestration,
   insights, network management, knowledge access, and standardisation.
   Interviews conducted with industry experts provided evidence in support
   of the identified dynamic capabilities. A novel firm capability dataset
   was created using secondary data, and using fuzzy-set Qualitative

	abstract = {This study enters the debate on the interplay between digital
   technologies and the pursuit of sustainable development goals in
   organizations. The article investigates whether external pressures at
   the supply chain level push companies toward a digital and green (twin)
   transition, and how this effect differs according to company size and
   their collaborative relationships. Using a sample of fashion industry
   firms located in northeastern Italy, we propose and test a conceptual
   model by applying a moderated mediation analysis. Our proposed model
   suggests that collaborative partnerships between firms are essential in
   leveraging digital technologies for a green transition, emphasizing the
   importance of coordinating technological adoption across the value
   chain. Results confirm that adopting collaborative partnerships boosts
   companies' willingness and ability to leverage digital technologies
   toward the green transition. Moreover, we found that the positive
   relationship between external pressures for technology adoption and
   firms' collaborative behavior is moderated by firm dimension. On one
   hand, when external pressures for digital transformation increase,
   smaller firms tend to collaborate more frequently than larger ones. On
   the other hand, regardless of size, all firms demonstrate increased
   collaboration when facing the highest pressure levels. This study offers
   novel insights into the importance of interorganizational collaborations
   at the supply chain level in companies' twin transitions.},

	abstract = {Objective Using digital systems to support the management and delivery
   of social care is a priority for UK governments. This study explored
   progress towards, and experiences of, digitalisation in the homecare
   sector and providers' views on contributing client data to a national
   policy/research dataset.Methods Over 150 UK homecare providers completed
   an on-line survey (October-December 2022). The survey was hosted on
   Qualtrics and comprised fixed- and free-text response questions. The
   recruited sample aligned with the profile of UK homecare providers in
   terms of use of digital systems, organisation type and size.Results
   Almost all respondents (95.5\%) were using digital systems, in part or
   exclusively, to support care delivery. However, many (42.7\%) reported a
   desire to further digitalise or a dissatisfaction with existing systems.
   Findings highlight the time and work involved in choosing a a software
   system, with the decision regarded as relatively high risk. Over 50
   different software systems were being used across the sample. Most
   respondents (72.5\%) supported the creation of a national dataset on
   homecare users. However, support and recompense are likely to needed to
   secure buy-in from what is a predominantly private sector
   context.Conclusions Findings suggest a complex and changing situation,
   with numerous different digital systems being used and the sector at
   different stages of digitalisation. The high-pressure, low margin
   context of UK homecare appeared to be exerting an influence on progress
   towards digitalisation. Evaluations of government strategies to
   stimulate and support digitalisation in this diverse and predominantly
   private sector context will be valuable.},

	abstract = {Background In most low- and middle-income countries, health facility
   regulation is fragmented, ineffective and under-resourced. The Kenyan
   Government piloted an innovative regulatory regime involving Joint
   Health Inspections (JHI) which synthesized requirements across multiple
   regulatory agencies; increased inspection frequency; digitized
   inspection tools; and introduced public display of regulatory results.
   The pilot significantly improved regulatory compliance. We calculated
   the costs of the development and implementation of the JHI pilot and
   modelled the costs of national scale-up in Kenya. Methods We calculated
   the economic costs of three phases: JHI checklist development, start-up
   activities, and first year of implementation, from the providers'
   perspective in three pilot counties. Data collection involved extraction
   from expenditure records and key informant interviews. The annualized
   costs of JHI were calculated by adding annualized development and
   start-up costs to annual implementation costs. National level scale-up
   costs were also modelled and compared to those of current standard
   inspections. Results The total economic cost of the JHI pilot was USD
   1,125,600 (2017 USD), with the development phase accounting for 19\%,
   start-up 43\% and the first year of implementation 38\%. The annualized
   economic cost was USD 519,287, equivalent to USD 206 per health facility
   visit and USD 311 per inspection completed. Scale up to the national
   level, while replacing international advisors with local staff, was
   estimated to cost approximately USD 4,823,728, equivalent to USD 103 per
   health facility visit and USD 155 per inspection completed. This
   compares to an estimated USD 86,997 per year (USD 113 per inspection
   completed) spent on a limited number of inspections prior to JHI.
   Conclusion Information on costs is essential to consider affordability
   and value for money of regulatory interventions. This is the first study
   we are aware of costing health facility inspections in sub-Saharan
   Africa. It has informed debates on appropriate inspection design and
   potential efficiency gains. It will also serve as an important benchmark
   for future studies, and a key input into cost-effectiveness analyses.},

	abstract = {The multifaceted global challenges such as the ever-growing food demand,
   climate change and rising commodity prices bring to the fore the need
   for more productive food systems. Irrigation is arguably a principal
   strategy to increase agricultural productivity and improve the
   resilience to climate change. A systems-based approach to produce more
   food with less resources, through innovative practices and digital
   tools, can support integrated information for water management to
   strengthen resources' governance and inform decision-making.
   Context-based innovations must target end users with aims for inclusive
   governance, recognizing gender and indigenous and traditional knowledge.
   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
   accelerates actions with partners such as the International Commission
   on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) by mobilizing data, innovation and
   technology through diverse stakeholder groups through inclusive and
   gender-responsive approaches, to guide, through national strategies,
   regional platforms and collaboration, agricultural development, and

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has been envisioned as an enabler of the
   digital transformation that can enhance different features of people's
   daily lives, such as healthcare, home automation, and smart
   transportation. The vast amount of data generated by a massive number of
   devices in an IoT system could lead to a severe performance problem.
   Edge cloud computing and network function virtualization (NFV)
   technologies are potential approaches to improve the efficiency of
   resource use and the flexibility of responsive services in an IoT
   system. In this paper, we consider the joint optimization problem of
   gateway placement and multihop routing in the IoT layer, the problem of
   service placement in the edge and cloud layers of an NFV-enabled IoT
   system in edge cloud computing (NIoT). We propose three optimization
   models (i.e., GMO, SP1O, SP2O) that allow an IoT service provider to
   find the optimal deployment of gateways, the optimal resource allocation
   for service functions, and the optimal routing according to a cost
   function with a performance constraint in a NIoT system. We then develop
   three approximation algorithms (i.e., GMA, SP1A, SP2A) for tackling the
   problems in a large-scale NIoT system. The evaluation results under a
   set of scenarios with various topologies and parameters show that the
   approximation algorithms can obtain results close to the optimal
   solution with a significant reduction in computation time. We also
   derive new insights into the strategy for an IoT provider to optimize
   its objectives. Specifically, the results suggest that an IoT provider
   should select an appropriate service placement strategy with regard to a
   charging agreement with an NFV infrastructure provider, and only deploy
   service functions with a strict delay requirement on the edge of
   networks for optimizing its cost.},

	abstract = {Purpose The construction organisations in developing countries are
   lagging in digital technology usage; hence, they are still characterised
   by poor project delivery and technological backwardness. To checkmate
   this problem, partnering with other organisations was proposed, while
   critical factors needed for successful digital partnering of
   construction organisations were assessed. Design/methodology/approach
   The study adopted a qualitative research approach. Delphi method was
   used to get experts' opinion on some identified factors necessary for
   successful digital partnering. The experts for the study were selected
   using defined criteria, and a combination of interquartile deviation,
   Kendall's coefficient of concordance and chi-square was used to achieve
   robust consensus among respondents. Mann-Whitney U test was also used to
   ascertain the difference in perception of experts. Findings The findings
   revealed trust in digital partners, top management support and digital
   partner selection as the three key success factors for partnering. Other
   factors that can be considered alongside these main factors are the
   creation of a common goal, a long-term commitment, effective
   communication, proper conflict resolution and structured as well as
   continuous digital training, workshops and meetings. Practical
   implications Instead of going through the digitalisation journey alone,
   construction organisations, particularly in a developing country like
   South Africa, stand a better chance of surviving the dynamic
   construction and digital environment by partnering with other
   organisations within and outside the industry. Carefully selecting the
   right partner, trusting in their capability and ensuring constant
   commitment is necessary for the success of the process.
   Originality/value The value of this study lies in its ability to
   showcase the critical success factors needed for effective digital
   partnering, an aspect that lacks adequate consideration in the
   digitalisation of construction industry discourse.},

	abstract = {Big Data has recently emerged as a new digital paradigm, one that
   companies adopt in order to both transform existing business models and
   nurture their innovation activities. The peculiarities of Big Data
   applications span different fields such as customer need identification,
   risk management and decision-making, data-driven knowledge, product and
   service design, quality management, and opportunity recognition and
   creation. However, while these have resulted in the emergence of a rich
   research domain focusing on the managerial and practical implications
   typically addressed from the user perspective, there is still a lack of
   complete understanding of how companies that provide Big Data solutions
   can create and capture value from them. This paper explores the question
   of how provider companies create and capture value from Big Data,
   drawing on a multiple-case study analysis of provider companies that
   offer solutions and services based on Big Data. The results illustrate a
   theoretical framework on value creation and capture by relying on Big
   Data and identify two main innovation service strategies based on Big
   Data used by provider companies. In addition, this paper provides
   valuable insights as to how the network of involved stakeholders

	abstract = {Online platform businesses can grow massively and rapidly. But what if a
   company's business model features both an online platform application
   and a physical product, as is the case in logistics (e.g. container
   distribution), consumer retail (e.g. food delivery), or mobility (e.g.
   booking of shared rental vehicles)? Online-to-offline platform
   businesses must synchronise online platform growth with offline product
   transaction growth because online platforms may attract users, but value
   generation and capture occur through offline product transactions. If
   one outpaces the other, either demand cannot be satisfied, or costs
   increase disproportionally. How do online-to-offline platform businesses
   navigate this dilemma? We report on the exemplary case of Vytal, an
   innovative startup that has managed to become the world-largest provider
   of smart reusable packaging solutions in the food retail sector. Vytal
   couples the distribution of offline food containers with an online
   transaction platform application that connects restaurants, canteens,
   and supermarkets with consumers. We trace how Vytal strategically
   organised and orchestrated their growth online and offline. Based on our
   analysis, we offer a framework containing practical lessons for how
   companies can grow online-to-offline platform business models and
   navigate the trade-offs between the online and offline components of
   such business models.},

	abstract = {The so-called digital transformation of the construction industry is
   essential to overcoming long-standing global productivity stagnation.
   This transformation aims to adopt the latest technological developments
   and methodologies to improve construction productivity while supporting
   data-informed decision-making. However, the construction sector has
   fallen short of meeting the fast-growing population's demands for
   sustainable quality infrastructure at the required pace as it has not
   yet taken full advantage of these advancements. Despite broad experience
   in managing projects, when it comes to modeling, monitoring, and
   re-engineering processes, the construction industry has fallen behind
   several other industries. To overcome these challenges, efficient
   construction processes and operational strategies are essential to
   keeping organizations competitive and meeting market demands. In this
   regard, even though several studies on process modeling and management
   in construction exist, research on construction process improvement and
   automation through data-driven process mining remains understudied.
   Moreover, the literature lacks a comprehensive review of
   process-oriented studies with practical industry insights. To fill these
   gaps, this paper aims to provide an exhaustive analysis of process
   mining, modeling, and management as reported by the most current state
   of the literature in the architecture, engineering,
   construction/facility management (AEC/FM) domain coupled with a current
   industry perspective. As a result, the authors: (1) propose a conceptual
   process classification framework that considers the broad spectrum of
   process-oriented studies in the existing literature; (2) identify
   construction processes commonly present across a project's life cycle;
   (3) design and conduct structured interviews with subject matter experts
   to validate identified processes and get industry insights about them;
   (4) spot major literature gaps describing future research opportunities;
   and (5) develop a business process model canvas template that supports
   construction organizations in improving their corporate memory and
   pursuing construction productivity growth by better managing,
   monitoring, and automating construction processes.},

	abstract = {Due to the degree of exposure to activities carried out through digital
   channels, digital transformation is no longer an avoidable option for
   companies. However, being exposed to an eminently digital environment
   does not automatically make companies able to embrace the benefits of
   digitalisation. Therefore, it is vital to explore the mechanisms that
   enable companies to transform their digital transformation efforts and
   activities into results. That is, what are the capabilities that enable
   firms, depending on their degree of digitalisation (being either digital
   users or digital providers), to achieve effective value generation and
   value appropriation? The analysis of a sample of 204 companies belonging
   to four European countries was performed on a causal competence model
   using PLS-SEM to answer the research questions. Results show that
   digital enterprises are ``greener{''} only if the business model
   includes sustainability and that only for digital users is the degree of
   being a digital company positively related to managerial and sustainable
   capabilities. Similarly, we found an indirect, positive effect between
   being digital and having managerial and sustainable capabilities through
   the mediation of digital capabilities, especially for digital providers,
   exposing the complementarity of these capabilities.},

	abstract = {The digital age has brought about a need for organizations to utilize
   Digital Twins to improve operational efficiency and decision-making.
   However, it is difficult for companies to identify and prioritize
   Digital Twin initiatives that meet the needs of their stakeholders and
   align with the capabilities of the company and its strategic plans. This
   paper proposes a methodology for the systematic identification and
   prioritization of Digital Twin applications in complex industrial
   settings. The methodology begins by documenting business requirements,
   current processes, and challenges, and subsequently identifying areas
   with potential benefits from Digital Twins through the use of an
   opportunity scoring system. To refine the portfolio of Digital Twin
   applications to include only those that are impactful and viable, the
   feasibility of Digital Twin is quantified by evaluating technological
   (technical capacity and digital skills), organizational, and project
   risk factors. To validate the proposed methodology, a case study was
   conducted in collaboration with an industrial partner specializing in
   injection molding. This real-world application demonstrates the
   effectiveness of our approach in identifying and prioritizing Digital
   Twin applications in a complex industrial context. This research
   contributes to the growing body of knowledge surrounding Digital Twins,
   providing organizations with a structured approach to leverage the
   potential of this transformative technology.},

	abstract = {Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need to keep pace with large
   enterprises, thus they need to digitally transform. Since they usually
   lack resources (budget, knowledge, and time) many countries have their
   support environment to help SMEs in this endeavor. To be able to ensure
   the right kinds of support, it is crucial to assess the digital maturity
   of an enterprise. There are many models and assessment tools for digital
   maturity, however, they are either theoretical models, partial, vendor
   oriented, or suited for large enterprises. In this paper, we address the
   problem of assessing digital maturity for SMEs. For this purpose, we
   developed a multi-attribute model for assessment of the digital maturity
   of an SME. We followed the design science research approach, where the
   multi-attribute model is considered as an IT artifact. Within the design
   cycle, the decision expert (DEX) methodology of a broader
   multi-attribute decision making methodologies was applied. The developed
   model was validated by a group of experts and upgraded according to
   their feedback and finally evaluated on seven real-life cases. Results
   show that the model can be used in real business situations.},

   of circular economy, manufacturing, and sustainable development.
   Enterprises need to choose a digital supply chain partner (DSCP) during
   the process of digital transformation in uncertain and sustainable
   environments. Thus, the research constructs an innovative decision
   methodology for selecting the optimal DSCP to achieve digital
   transformation. The proposed methodology is propounded based upon the
   entropy measure, generalized Dombi operators, integrated
   weight-determination model, and complex proportional assessment (COPRAS)
   method under spherical fuzzy circumstances. Specifically, a novel
   entropy measure is proposed for measuring the fuzziness of spherical
   fuzzy (SF) sets, while generalized Dombi operators are presented for
   fusing SF information. The related worthwhile properties of these
   operators are discussed. Further, an integrated criteria
   weight-determination model is presented by incorporating objective
   weights obtained from the SF entropy-based method and subjective weights
   from the SF best worst method. Afterward, an improvement of the COPRAS
   method is proposed based on the presented generalized Dombi operators
   with SF information. Lastly, the practicability and validity of the
   proposed methodology are verified by an empirical study that selects an
   appropriate DSCP for a new energy vehicle enterprise to finish the goal
   of digital transformation. The sensitivity and comparative analysis are
   carried out to illustrate the stability, reliability, and superiority of
   the propounded methodology from multiple perspectives. The results and
   conclusions indicate that the propounded method affords a synthetic and
   systematic uncertain decision-making framework for identifying the
   optimal DSCP with incomplete weight information.},

	abstract = {Digitalization is viewed as a source of future competitiveness due to
   its potential for unlocking new valuecreation and revenue-generation
   opportunities. To profit from digitalization, providers and customers
   tend to move away from transactional product-centric model to relational
   service-oriented engagement. This relational transformation is brought
   about through digital servitization. However, current knowledge about
   how providers and customers transform their relationship to achieve
   benefits from digital servitization is lacking. This paper addresses
   that knowledge gap by applying the relational view theory to a study of
   four provider-customer relationships engaged in digital servitization.
   The results provide evidence for four relational components -
   complementary digitalization capabilities, relation-specific digital
   assets, digitally enabled knowledge-sharing routines, and partnership
   governance - that enable providers and customers to profit from digital
   servitization. A key contribution is the development of a relational
   transformation framework for digital servitization that provides an
   overview of how the four relational components evolve as the
   relationship progresses. In doing so, we contribute to the emerging
   servitization literature by offering key relational insights into the
   interdependence of activities throughout the transformation phases of
   provider-customer relationships in digital servitization.},

   certification process; and Communication, Education, and Outreach. CMS
   and its partners addressed over 100 recommendations to improve the eCQM
   development, implementation, and reporting experience by creating
   implementation strategies. This included the development of new tools,
   such as the Measure Collaboration (MC) Workspace and ongoing testing of
   Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based standards for
   quality measurement.

	abstract = {This paper presents a consensus view on Responsible Innovation by a
   group of industry practitioners, each with high level management
   experience in driving innovation from within industrial companies
   operating in different sectors. The authors argue that, while a
   substantial body of academic research on Responsible Research \&
   Innovation (RRI) of potential interest now exists, it is failing to have
   impact in the industrial community, where it is understood to be
   partially targeted, because many of the concepts, tools and
   methodologies are not aligned with current industrial practices. This is
   leading to a misconception as to where industry stands on topics
   addressed by RRI and difficulties in forwarding a dialogue that is
   meaningful to both parties. The need to distinguish between processes
   relating to research and innovation is argued, together with the view
   that research into RRI should encompass more of the on-going work being
   carried out in related fields such as the role of companies in society,
   the debate around Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate
   Shared Value (CSV), responsible digital innovation, the elements of
   ethical leadership, sustainable investment policies and work on
   establishing social impact factors as well as public concerns on
   innovation. Directions for an alignment of the terminology and concepts
   are also proposed. This paper is to be viewed as an attempt at bridging
   perspectives with the aim of finding common ground to develop the field
   of RRI further so that it provides effective concepts, tools and
   methodologies to guide industrial innovation towards better societal

	abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the negative effect of knowledge hiding on
   the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) capability and
   open innovation (inbound and outbound) when partner trustworthiness
   (benevolence, integrity, and ability) is high. Structural equations were
   used to test this three-way interaction with survey data from a sample
   of 229 firms, mainly from highly digitalized sectors. The findings
   indicate that interorganizational knowledge hiding affects only the
   relationship between AI capability and outbound open innovation and that
   partner ability is the only factor that will counteract this negative
   effect. Therefore, coexploitation of AI-based solutions with external
   allies is the sole scenario to encourage knowledge hiding by increasing
   employees' perceptions of the likelihood of AI negatively impacting
   their personal interests at work. Moreover, when trustworthiness is at
   the forefront of the intraorganizational discussion, the findings
   downplay the significance of benevolence and integrity as traits that
   significantly reduce knowledge hiding. In contrast, at the
   interorganizational level, knowledge hiding is lessened only when
   employees perceive that co-exploitation with external partners

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 involves the incorporation of advanced digital technologies
   into manufacturing operations, bringing significant changes to social,
   technical, organizational, and environmental aspects of companies.
   However, there is limited knowledge of how companies manage these
   changes. This study aims to discuss how companies develop the necessary
   sociotechnical factors for successfully implementing Industry 4.0 and
   the mechanisms driving these changes. The study considers this as an
   initial stage towards transitioning to an Industry 5.0 concept, which
   integrates workers and technologies in a balanced system. A qualitative
   approach, including cross-case and ethnographic analyses, was employed
   to identify the various sociotechnical enabling factors with 28
   companies implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. The results highlight
   strategic guidelines developed by companies, such as top management
   support and open innovation with partners and startups. Companies can
   start by defining an implementation roadmap, training leaders in
   technical concepts with technology providers and technical schools and
   providing management support with company-wide programs for Industry
   4.0. Additionally, the study describes how hierarchical flexibility,
   increased autonomy for workers through participation in decision
   processes, data training, and open communication are developed.
   Interactions between dimensions include upskilling workers with
   technology providers, aligning technologies with worker profiles and
   tasks, and incorporating data collection and use into processes. Unlike
   previous research that has mainly addressed enabling factors for
   Industry 4.0 from an individual perspective, this study analyzes their
   interactions and discusses practical development within companies.},

	abstract = {Traditional literature in terms of Open Innovation broadly explored the
   potential benefits firms might achieve in collaborating with external
   partners. However, in such a recognized framework, the investigation of
   the costs firms face remains an underexplored field. Understanding the
   immediate economic impact of Open Innovation strategies is crucial,
   especially for SMEs that usually suffer from a structural lack of
   financial resources. To fill this gap, the present study explores the
   costs sustained by SMEs in the short run while implementing Open
   Innovation's strategies. Moreover, in line with the new challenges
   introduced by new technologies, the study explores how Open Innovation
   costs vary for digital and non-digital SMEs. In doing so, the study
   relies on a sample of 377 digital and non-digital European SMEs. In
   general terms, results show that Open Innovation represents a short-term
   cost for both types of SMEs. However, in investigating the different
   Open Innovation challenges addressed by SMEs, findings reveal that
   especially digital SMEs may limit costs by reducing their external
   activities and keeping their activity focused on the core business.
   These findings have implications for both SMEs and scholars, which are
   expected to lead to further investigations.},

   permitted us to uncover that work- and system-related disruptions follow
   the process of agricultural digitalisation. The study also indicated
   that innovating digitally is a collective process in which, however,
   some actors independently attempt to elevate their positions through
   weaving, that is, engaging in networking practices. On the other hand,
   despite their intense efforts to promote these technologies to farmers,
   innovation brokers, technology providers and researchers are not
   actively involved in the process of co-creating value for and with
   farmers. We conclude by arguing that digital technologies are not
   scope-neutral devices and by pointing out the need for redefining what

   regular evaluation of suppliers to select resources. E-book resources
   were used as the starting point to examine the method of supplier

   hierarchical process to integrate and weight perspectives from
   e-vendors, academics, and professional librarians. Findings demonstrate
   that both traditional and ``smart{''} factors impact the final
   evaluation of e-book suppliers. In addition, the influence of smart
   service factors on the efficacy of library innovation can be evaluated
   by the linear regression method. Two systematic methods in the
   assessment of e-book suppliers were outlined and the concept of ``smart

	abstract = {This study seeks to analyse the influence of strategic stakeholders and
   Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies on the circularity of supply chains
   among Brazilian agtech companies. A survey was conducted using a
   national database of Brazilian agtechs. The results indicate that: (i)
   strategic stakeholders significantly influence the adoption of circular
   economy practices, of which rural producers, small and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs), consumers, universities, and technology suppliers
   have the most impact on agtech supply chains; (ii) agtechs are
   predominantly adopting AI and big data technologies to increase the
   circularity of supply chain operations; however, contrary to
   expectations, I4.0 technologies do not show a statistically significant
   influence on circularity in the analysed context. This study reveals a
   trend towards circularity linked to operational efficiency and
   digitalisation; stakeholder engagement spans from the selection of
   technological standards to more selective consumption behaviours in this
   sector, involving high technological standards, complex and valuable
   resources, and a transition towards circularity supported by specific
   I4.0 technologies. The findings of this study are pertinent for enabling
   more assertive stakeholder engagement, generating data to support public
   policies and programmes aimed at strengthening the agtech sector; the
   identification of a technological trend in the agtech sector can be
   leveraged by technology suppliers and investors.},

	abstract = {Organizations must learn to innovate in new ways when pursuing digital
   transformation with ``big data analytics{''} (BDA). By analyzing an
   interorganizational relationship in which both vendor and client try to
   develop new products and services with BDA, this research examines the
   conditions under which BDA prompts organizations to explore novel
   innovation processes. Over the course of this longitudinal case study,
   the partners find that a service-dominant logic around capturing value
   no longer applies. Rather, the uncertainty of BDA innovation prompts a
   learning logic around creating value through collective experimentation.
   To explain these changes to the logic for innovation and
   interorganizational processes, we report four discoveries about the
   relationship between organizational learning under uncertainty,
   collective experimentation, and innovation trajectory shifts with BDA.
   This research provides a contextual understanding of creating value with
   BDA in interorganizational relationships and contributes to the

	abstract = {PurposeDigital servitization research has focused on how manufacturing
   firms use digital technologies to change business models and offer smart
   services; less attention has been devoted to the degree to which
   external actors in the existing ecosystem accept these smart services.
   Therefore, the authors pose the following research question: How does a
   manufacturing firm introduce and gain acceptance of new smart services
   within an established ecosystem?Design/methodology/approachBuilding on
   servitization, ecosystem and legitimacy theories, this paper addresses
   the research question through an in-depth case study of a world-leading
   original equipment manufacturer that is currently developing and
   introducing new smart services in its existing ecosystem.FindingsThe
   findings suggest that external actors emphasize different types of
   legitimacy in deciding whether to accept a new smart service. The
   findings also show that the type of legitimacy required to gain
   acceptance changes throughout the development of the smart service, from
   the definition of the value proposition to the design and delivery of
   the service.Practical implicationsThis study can assist smart service
   providers in identifying which type of legitimacy is important for each
   ecosystem actor and strengthening these types of legitimacy to gain
   acceptance from the ecosystem.Originality/valueThis study develops a
   framework to help describe the thresholds for acceptance of a smart
   service through the development phases, as well as to indicate the types
   of legitimacy that smart service providers must relate to when seeking
   to gain acceptance for their new offering.},

@article{WOS:000685209200009,
	abstract = {Objective: The Global Digital Exemplar (GDE) Program is a national
   attempt to accelerate digital maturity in healthcare providers through
   promoting knowledge transfer across the English National Health Service
   (NHS). ``Blueprints{''}-documents capturing implementation
   experience-were intended to facilitate this knowledge transfer. Here we
   explore how Blueprints have been conceptualized, produced, and used to
   promote interorganizational knowledge transfer across the NHS.
   Materials and Methods: We undertook an independent national qualitative
   evaluation of the GDE Program. This involved collecting data using
   semistructured interviews with implementation staff and clinical leaders
   in provider organizations, nonparticipant observation of meetings, and
   key documents. We also attended a range of national meetings and
   conferences, interviewed national program managers, and analyzed a range
   of policy documents. Our analysis drew on sociotechnical principles,
   combining deductive and inductive methods.
   Results: Data comprised 508 interviews, 163 observed meetings, and
   analysis of 325 documents. We found little evidence of Blueprints being
   adopted in the manner originally conceived by national program managers.
   However, they proved effective in different ways to those planned. As
   well as providing a helpful initial guide to a topic, we found that
   Blueprints served as a method of identifying relevant expertise that
   paved the way for subsequent discussions and richer knowledge transfers
   amongst provider organizations. The primary value of Blueprinting,
   therefore, seemed to be its role as a networking tool. Members of
   different organizations came together in developing, applying, and
   sustaining Blueprints through bilateral conversations-in some
   circumstances also fostering informal communities of practice.
   Conclusions: Blueprints may be effective in facilitating knowledge
   transfer among healthcare organizations, but need to be accompanied by
   other evolving methods, such as site visits and other networking
   activities, to iteratively transfer knowledge and experience.},

	abstract = {BackgroundRural populations experience ongoing health inequities with
   disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rates, but digital
   health in rural settings is poorly studied. Our research question was:
   How does digital health influence healthcare outcomes in rural settings?
   The objective was to identify how digital health capability enables the
   delivery of outcomes in rural settings according to the quadruple aims
   of healthcare: population health, patient experience, healthcare costs
   and provider experience.MethodsA multi-site qualitative case study was
   conducted with interviews and focus groups performed with healthcare
   staff (n = 93) employed in rural healthcare systems (n = 10) in the
   state of Queensland, Australia. An evidence-based digital health
   capability framework and the quadruple aims of healthcare served as
   classification frameworks for deductive analysis. Theoretical analysis
   identified the interrelationships among the capability dimensions, and
   relationships between the capability dimensions and healthcare
   outcomes.ResultsSeven highly interrelated digital health capability
   dimensions were identified from the interviews: governance and
   management; information technology capability; people, skills, and
   behaviours; interoperability; strategy; data analytics; consumer centred
   care. Outcomes were directly influenced by all dimensions except
   strategy. The interrelationship analysis demonstrated the influence of
   strategy on all digital health capability dimensions apart from data
   analytics, where the outcomes of data analytics shaped ongoing strategic
   efforts.ConclusionsThe study indicates the need to coordinate
   improvement efforts targeted across the dimensions of digital
   capability, optimise data analytics in rural settings to further support
   strategic decision making, and consider how consumer-centred care could
   influence digital health capability in rural healthcare services.
   Digital transformation in rural healthcare settings is likely to
   contribute to the achievement of the quadruple aims of healthcare if
   transformation efforts are supported by a clear, resourced digital
   strategy that is fit-for-purpose to the nuances of rural healthcare
   delivery.},

	abstract = {Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) have been considered the `entrance
   door' to the Industry 4.0 journey. As part of this journey, this system
   must operate in real-time and be integrated with several other systems,
   resulting in modular adaptation and customized implementation of this
   solution. This increased complexity underscores the importance of the
   relationship between companies and their technology providers, requiring
   intensive knowledge-sharing (KS) activities between the parties. In
   particular, information asymmetry between buyers and MES 4.0 providers
   may be critical for the successful implementation of the system, but
   little is known about this issue, which has a high impact on the first
   stage of the Industry 4.0 journey. Thus, we aim to understand how
   knowledge sharing affects information asymmetry between buyers and
   technology providers for MES 4.0 implementation. Our investigation is
   based on qualitative interviews with 56 key experts from 33 companies,
   which allowed us first to define MES configurations for Industry 4.0,
   i.e., MES 4.0 as a differentiation from early versions of MES. Then, we
   conducted a multiple case study with three buyer-provider dyads in the
   pre-and post-contract phases of MES purchasing to analyze KS dynamics
   during the implementation of MES 4.0. We propose a model that explains
   the relationship between MES 4.0 complexity and KS intensity and a
   decision framework that describes the steps for MES 4.0 implementation
   while focusing on reducing information asymmetry during the
   collaboration.},

   interorganizational projects. Based on conceptual reasoning in light of
   prior research, as well as illustrative empirical insights into an
   ongoing interorganizational project in the construction industry, we
   argue that partner selection practices not only target the
   organizational capabilities of potential partners but they themselves
   require an organizational capability to search for, evaluate, and
   select. This article delineates the facets of this capability, reveals
   the role of digital capabilities therein, and shows that the respective
   capabilities are crucial for inclusion and exclusion in
   interorganizational projects. The results also point to capabilities
   that emerge at the interorganizational nexus.},

	abstract = {The power of platform business models has grown as our economies become
   increasingly digital, but how companies address the challenge of
   platform growth to achieve a critical mass of users remains unclear. In
   this study, we take a business model (BM) perspective to understand how
   mobile payment platform providers go about addressing such a challenge.
   We studied how mobile payment providers engaged in innovation of their
   business models, and thus identified three pertaining aspects:
   rethinking the relationship management with retailers, creating
   partnerships with other actors in the payment ecosystem to complement
   and deliver the proposed value, and integrating and using front-end
   mobile technology. Furthermore, our study suggests that mobile payment
   providers need to adapt their role within the ecosystem to scale the
   platform, and that it will depend on their choice of scope of geographic
   availability. Finally, we suggest that mutual adaptation of BMs of
   platform-associated actors leads to improved diffusion of the platform
   offer, which also hints at the need for researchers to revisit
   innovation diffusion and technology adoption theories by acknowledging
   the importance of the BM of the offer side of technology.},

	abstract = {The financial industry has undergone several changes in recent years.
   One of these changes is the emergence of financial technology (FinTech)
   companies that are radically transforming the industry, posing a
   significant challenge to traditional commercial banks. In this study, we
   examined the responses of the Hungarian banks to the emergence of
   innovative FinTech startups and explored the benefits and barriers of
   the FinTech accelerator programs launched by banks. We conducted 27
   semi-structured interviews with top executives of banks, FinTech
   startups and scaleups, investors and regulators to identify the
   potential benefits and barriers during the cooperation between banks and
   FinTechs. The most important results of our research show that during
   the partnership, several advantages can be gained by both parties.
   Still, the realization of these benefits is significantly hindered by
   the excessive exploitation focus of banks. Ambidextrous internal
   champions or suppliers of the banks are needed for successful
   cooperation between FinTechs and banks.},

	abstract = {Background: Hospitals may adopt various information transmission methods
   to participate in health information exchange (HIE) programs. However,
   even if they adopt multiple mechanisms, they may not actively use all of
   them to send inside information. This study analyzes the frequently used
   methods for sending data and the common barriers blocking sending
   practices in hospital settings. Methods: Our sample included 3,015
   community hospitals that reported their methods of sending patient
   health information in the 2019 American Hospital Association Information
   Technology Supplement Survey. The relationship between obstacles
   hospitals experienced and their use of the information-sending method
   was analyzed by using robust Poisson regression models.Results:
   Many-to-many exchanges that involve intermediaries such as a health
   information service provider (HISP), electronic health record (EHR)
   vendor-based network, and national network, once adopted, were more
   often used by hospitals than one-to-one exchange methods such as
   provider portals and direct access to EHR by login credentials.
   Hospitals that lacked the technical capability to electronically send
   patient health information were less likely to use any of the methods (p
   <.01), while hospitals located in a more concentrated market were more
   likely to send information to outside providers by using provider
   portal, interface connection and national network (p <.01).Discussion:
   There is still a notable gap between hospitals' adoption and the actual
   use of different HIE methods to send inside information to outside
   organizations. Results argue that even if hospitals adopted an HIE
   method, they might not necessarily participate in the actual sharing of
   information, and the method may remain unused due to several usage
   barriers.Conclusion: Hospital and market-level barriers associated with
   using one-to-one and many-to-many HIE methods for sharing information
   may affect progress in interoperability. Examining the barriers to using
   multiple HIE methods and their impact on interoperability could offer
   implications for health information technology (IT) policy and inform
   health system leaders.},

	abstract = {IntroductionIn the process of growing societies, and especially in the
   digital era we live in, there is a need for a strong push for innovation
   that puts citizens at the center of the process from the beginning to
   build more resilient, cooperative and flexible communities. Different
   collaborative design approaches have emerged in recent decades, one of
   the most interesting being Living Labs, which involves user-centered
   design and co-creative innovation that bring together different actors
   and roles. However, although these new methodologies are harnessing
   creativity, some aspects of this new, more ecosystemic and complex
   vision are not clearly understood: possible barriers, how to facilitate
   local and operational solutions, overcoming institutional blockage,
   integrating new roles, etc. MethodsThe incorporation of the Quintuple
   Helix as a driver to ensure greater coordinated participation of local
   actors has proven its usefulness and impact during the re-adaptation of
   LifeSpace (previously named Smart House Living Lab), managed by the
   Polytechnic University of Madrid (Spain), a transformation based on the
   experiences and lessons learned during the large-scale ACTIVAGE pilot
   funded by the European Commission, more specifically at the Madrid
   Deployment Site. It involved more than 350 older adult people and other
   stakeholders from different areas, including family members, formal and
   informal caregivers, hospital service managers, third-age associations,
   and public service providers, forming a sense of community, which was
   called MAHA. ResultsThe living lab infrastructure evolved from a single
   multi-purpose environment to incorporate three harmoniously competing
   environments: (1) THE LAB: Headquarters for planning, demonstration,
   initial design phases and entry point for newcomers to the process, (2)
   THE CLUB: Controlled interaction environment where returning users
   validate solutions, focusing mainly on AHA services (MAHA CLUB), such as
   exergames, social interaction applications, brain training activities,
   etc. (3) THE NEIGHBOURHOOD: Real-life environments for free and open
   interaction between actors and implementation of previously validated
   and tested solutions. ConclusionThe Quintuple Helix model applied in
   LifeSpace's new vision allows a coordinated involvement of a more
   diverse set of actors, beyond the end-users and especially those who are
   not traditionally part of research and innovation processes.},

   resource-rich environments. This raises the question of how new ventures
   can use cellular-level data from omics technologies to create new
   products and scale their business. We report on a series of interviews
   and a focus group discussion with entrepreneurs, investors, and data
   providers. By conceptualizing omics technologies as external enablers,
   we show how characteristics of cellular-level data negatively affect the
   combination mechanisms that drive venture creation and growth. We
   illustrate how data characteristics set boundary conditions for
   innovation and entrepreneurship and highlight how ventures seek to
   mitigate their impact.},

   activities-consulting, reporting, and communicating. Based on the
   iterations of design workshops that adopt a circular economy-based
   partner map design canvas for stakeholder analysis with procedures such
   as expert interviews and literature analysis, three partner/capability
   maps were generated to map stakeholders and explore the capabilities
   needed. ESG and carbon information digital and data skills emerged as
   the core capability to complete all the three tasks. A conceptual
   framework-a Smart System of ESG and Carbon Information-is proposed to
   summarize planning, operating, and communicating with ESG and carbon
   information, along with high-level organizational actions and talent
   capabilities. It identifies the building blocks of an ESG operating
   system within an enterprise to engage various stakeholders for
   value-creation collaboration. Despite the limitation of a lack of

	abstract = {Purpose - Pursuing digital transformation is a valuable strategy to
   attain companies' operational excellence and sustainable development.
   However, installing digital technologies and software is insufficient
   for achieving a successful digital transformation. Equally vital is
   providing digital solutions with reliable input data, which is a hard
   task in companies where information is gathered through manual or
   non-standardized processes. The lack of reliable data prevents
   technologies and software from operating at their best, hindering their
   ability to process information and derive correct insights for
   improvement. To avoid this, companies should embrace structured
   problem-solving approaches to evaluate current data retrieval processes,
   identify error sources and formulate countermeasures. This paper aims to
   provide an empirical study to substantiate A3 as a winning approach for
   advancing input data acquisition in companies.
   Design/methodology/approach - A case study research is proposed,
   investigating the application of A3 in an ink manufacturing company, and
   checking how A3 improves data collection and company performance.
   Findings - The case study corroborates A3 as an effective approach,
   allowing the removal of inefficiencies that previously went unnoticed
   and reaching a 10\% productivity improvement. Practical implications -

	abstract = {This paper primarily focuses on whether supply chains enterprises adopt
   a digital strategy and the impact of various government measures on
   supply chain digital decision-making. The study develops a multi-agent
   decision-making evolutionary game model to examine the stability of
   decision-making among the government, suppliers, and manufacturers.
   Additionally, a system dynamics model is established to analyze the
   governing dynamics within the supply chain's digital decision-making
   process, identifying characteristic patterns and trends. The analytical
   results of this study illustrate the government's strength thresholds
   exist regardless of ex-part penalties or the mix of rewards and
   punishment. Once the government's strength exceeds these thresholds, the
   evolutionary game system undergoes abrupt changes. Suppliers and
   manufacturers who adopt digital strategies are more affected by
   government penalties than incentives. The stronger the mix of government
   incentives and penalties, the higher the incentives for the supplier and
   the manufacturer to adopt a digital strategy, but the lower the
   incentives for the government to choose a regulatory strategy.
   Low-intensity mixed rewards and punishments, as well as low-intensity
   government rewards, are effective mechanisms for promoting government
   decision-making and supervision. Conversely, high government penalties
   do not motivate governments to choose regulatory strategies. The unit
   cost of products to deploy digital strategies directly affects the final
   digital strategy choice of supply chain enterprises. To choose a digital
   strategy, supply chain companies must ensure that the unit cost of
   products remains within a reasonable range.},

   important influence factor of partner selection, and explores the supply
   chain partner matching evaluation model under the three modes of
   unilateral decision-making, bilateral decision-making, and optimization
   of bilateral decision-making. The study shows that the bilateral

	abstract = {Digital technologies are transforming public service provision by
   affecting governments, technology vendors, and citizens, as well as
   their interactions. However, digital government transformation (DGT) is
   complex and challenging, with governments often lacking clear strategic
   adjustments during their digital journeys. This study discusses six
   strategic factors, including business environment, digital
   infrastructure, financial capability, innovation capability, information
   security, and public demand, and identifies the configurations that lead
   to a significant increase in digital government performance. Based on
   the theory of strategic action fields, we developed a theoretical
   framework to understand the DGT process and changes in configurations.
   Based on a novel Multiple Time Differencing Qualitative Comparative
   Analysis (MTD/QCA) method, the analysis of 31 provincial regions in
   Chinese mainland over four years derived 13 distinct solutions in the
   three basic stages of DGT: exploration, concentration, and
   complementation. These findings reveal the complexity of DGT from an
   evolutionary perspective and indicate that these factors do not work in
   isolation, but in combination with others to promote DGT. Understanding
   the configurational relationships of these factors can help governments
   adjust their strategies across the three stages of DGT.},

	abstract = {Prefabrication is increasingly recognized as a sustainable construction
   practice, with the efficiency of prefabricated component (PC) production
   lines playing a critical role in its success. However, supplier
   selection for PC production lines has become more complex due to
   evolving industrial demands, uncertain supply chain conditions, and
   operational complexities. This study addresses this gap by developing a
   lean-based AHP-improved VIKOR decision-making framework to enhance the
   supplier selection for PC production lines. The framework integrates
   advanced lean principles with universal and specific evaluation
   criteria, identified through a comprehensive literature review and
   expert interviews. Its validity was tested via a real-world case study
   with Yizhong Construction Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China. The results show
   that the three suppliers are ranked as Zhongjian > Tianyi > Xindadi,
   where Zhongjian is the best supplier in this case study, with a VIKOR
   index of 0.156. The findings show that the developed framework can
   improve the supplier selection efficiency by aligning with lean
   principles and enhancing the performance of PC production lines. By
   addressing the challenges of PC supplier selection, this study provides
   a practical tool to advance the adoption of prefabrication in
   construction. Furthermore, it contributes to the development of the PC
   industry by offering a robust method for the selection of suitable
   suppliers, which can help to optimize the production efficiency and
   support sustainable practices in construction.},

	abstract = {Overview: Faced with a rapidly changing business environment,
   organizations are increasingly turning to Agile project management to
   deliver innovation programs. Deployment of Agile poses specific
   challenges, often because the required skills, measures, and management
   behaviors differ greatly than those of traditional project management.
   When faced with a need to outsource Agile project delivery to a third
   party, organizations often apply contractual approaches developed for
   traditional ``waterfall{''} projects, which prove unsuitable. This study
   investigated the perspective of client-side advisors in Agile projects
   when delivery is outsourced to a third party. Client-side sourcing
   advisors are an important component of the Agile delivery ecosystem
   because clients often rely on advisors' experience when scoping out and
   procuring digital transformation projects.},

	abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to explore the use of digital technologies in
   enabling circular ecosystems. We apply supply network (SN) configuration
   theory and a novel resource pooling lens, more typically used in
   financial systems, to identify inventory pools, information repositories
   and financial exchange models among network
   actors.Design/methodology/approachFive in-depth circular SN case studies
   are examined where digital technologies are extensively deployed to
   support circularity, each case representing alternative SN
   configurations. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews to
   map SN and resource pooling configurations across each circular
   ecosystem, with cross-case analysis used to identify distinct pooling
   and digital strategies.FindingsResults suggest three digitally enabled
   circular ecosystem archetypes and their related governance modalities:
   consortia-based information pooling for resource recovery,
   intermediary-enabled material and financial pooling for remanufacturing
   and platform-driven information, material and financial pooling for
   resource optimisation.Research limitations/implicationsDrawing on SN
   configuration and resource pooling literature, we recognise distinct
   configurational, stakeholder and resource pooling dimensions
   characterising circular ecosystems. While this research is exploratory
   and the identified archetypes not exhaustive, the combination of
   resource pooling and configuration lenses offers new insights on
   circular ecosystem configurations and the critical role of resource
   pools and enabling digital technologies.Practical implicationsWe
   demonstrate the utility of the resource pooling and configuration
   approach in the design of digitally enabled circular ecosystems. These
   archetypes provide practitioners and policymakers with alternative
   design frameworks when considering circular SN
   transformations.Originality/valueThis paper introduces a resource
   netting and pooling configuration lens to circular ecosystems, analogous
   to financial systems, where cyclical flows and stock are critical and

	abstract = {Purpose Technological innovations such as smart mobile devices and
   mobile applications gave rise to a new business model: collaborative
   consumption. This business model, which is receiving significant
   attention from researchers and practitioners, is characterized by an
   intermediating digital platform that facilitates exchanges between
   customers and peer service providers. However, many digital platform
   providers still fail to build a critical mass of demand and supply.
   Accordingly, the aim of this research is to develop a better
   understanding of the barriers perceived by both customers and peer
   service providers. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a
   mixed-method qualitative approach to develop a comprehensive
   understanding of the factors that explain the rejection of collaborative
   consumption. In particular, six focus groups and 14 in-depth interviews
   were conducted, totaling 50 Belgian participants (with a mean age of 33
   years). In addition, 375 online critical incidents-retrieved from
   various sources, such as review websites and social networks-were used
   for triangulation purposes. All data were analyzed using a thematic
   analytic approach. Findings Customers and peer service providers reject
   collaborative consumption because of a complex set of multidimensional
   functional and psychological barriers. In particular, actors may
   perceive barriers related to complexity, value, risk, compatibility,
   contamination, image, and responsibility, which prevent them from
   participating in collaborative consumption. Originality/value This paper
   builds theory on the reasons why both customers and peer service
   providers reject collaborative consumption. The research identifies
   several barriers that were not captured in prior research. Digital
   platform providers can use the research findings to more fully
   understand actors' decision-making processes in collaborative
   consumption.},

	abstract = {Although research on risk management (RM) in small- and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs) in general and regarding supply chains (SCs) has
   increased recently, our understanding is still rather fragmented and
   underdeveloped. This refers particularly to new types of risks such as
   dynamic crises or emerging risks associated with digital transformation
   (DT). Therefore, the purpose of this exploratory paper is to investigate
   RM in SMEs in SCs. More precisely, the aim is to identify patterns that
   can be used to group SMEs according to their risk behavior (i.e., risk
   attitude and perception). Drawing from a data set of 181 European SMEs,
   this paper empirically conceptualizes a typology of SMEs. The typology
   consists of four distinct types of SMEs that emerged from a cluster
   analysis: collective risk eliminators, collective playing it safe
   seekers, collective risk-ignoring knights of fortune, and collective
   neglecting imperturbable ones. The findings indicate that different risk
   behavior leads to different degrees of collaboration within the SC.
   Furthermore, the close interconnection between RM as found in the
   different clusters and the respective firm's innovation performance can
   be shown. By acknowledging the heterogeneity found in SMEs, this paper
   breaks away from mainstream research that tends to consider SMEs as a
   homogeneous entity.},

	abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become the key technology for
   the digital transformation of the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) sector. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), as an
   open and vendor-neutral data model, play an essential role in this
   transformation. Despite all the recent advances of BIM, tunneling needs
   to catch up with other AEC sectors adopting digital technologies.
   Currently, IFC is mainly used to capture information directly connected
   to the structural elements of the final tunnel but rarely as a means to
   document the tunnel excavation and support. This article proposes an
   IFC-driven process for the execution phase of conventional tunneling
   projects by extending the usage of IFC to information about the process,
   labor, equipment, and employed material. The proposed process is
   evaluated by a case study demonstrating how to represent data from a
   conventional tunneling project by IFC. The results show that IFC
   provides the necessary concepts to express the data of the execution
   phase of conventional tunneling projects. Implementing an IFC-driven
   process in this phase significantly contributes to the digital
   transformation of tunneling projects.},

	abstract = {Background The recent Intergenerational Report (2023) highlighted that
   the Australian healthcare system will face increasing economic and
   logistical challenges, with projected growth in health spending due to
   an ageing population and an increasing number of chronic diseases.
   Shared care, a model emphasising collaboration between nursing and
   allied health, general practice and specialist care providers, has
   emerged as one solution. Objective This paper explores the contemporary
   shared care landscape in Australia, highlighting the digital
   transformation of healthcare, the adoption of eHealth technologies, and
   their impact on improving patient care coordination. Discussion The
   roles of shared electronic health records, secure electronic
   communication and consultation, electronic patient portals and
   telehealth in enhancing healthcare accessibility and management of
   chronic diseases are individually explored. Infrastructure for future
   inter-electronic medical record integrations are then discussed.
   Innovative care models combining novel technology and shared care hold
   promise for more efficient, patient-centric healthcare systems. Given
   Australia's unique healthcare challenges, it provides the ideal
   environment to lead the way in the digital transformation of shared
   care.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation provides an unprecedented opportunity for the
   exploration, integration, and utilization of scientific and
   technological resources (STR). In the wave of digital transformation,
   countries around the world have set up their own STR sharing platforms,
   which can match a variety of STR services and needs in a lower cost and
   more convenient way, and create interaction between the suppliers and
   demanders. These sharing platforms provide possibilities to realize the
   sharing economy in the field of scientific and technological innovation.
   However, it is also necessary to design the corresponding mechanisms to
   improve the sharing rate and sharing value. Therefore, in this article,
   we construct a new framework of operation mechanism for China `s STR
   allocation system and design its three submechanisms. Then, a system
   dynamics model of the operation mechanism is designed, and the
   experiments are carried out. The simulation results show that the
   mechanism proposed in this article can effectively improve the sharing
   rate and sharing value. Finally, some policy suggestions are put
   forward, which will help the government to improve management mode and

   supported by local partners, makes Dutch classrooms platform-ready by
   influencing how schools approach three key public governance
   responsibilities in their digital transformation: developing a vision
   for digital education, creating strategies for educational innovation
   and fostering digital literacy. Using the concept of soft power and
   extensive empirical research, the study shows how Microsoft aligns these
   responsibilities with its own corporate interests. As a result, the
   company gains control over schools' digital infrastructure - not only in
   terms of hardware and software but also in terms of its pedagogical
   design. The conclusion emphasises the importance of collective and

	abstract = {Despite increased interest and growing investments in web-based supply
   chain management (SCM) applications, firms face numerous challenges in
   successfully web-enabling their SCM activities. In this research, we
   focus on two main objectives - (i) to understand the key antecedents
   that affect the web-enablement of SCM activities; (ii) to document the
   performance impacts of web-enabled SCM efforts. Based on a large-scale,
   questionnaire survey of North American organizations, we assessed the
   influence of six factors namely - supplier synergy, information
   intensity, managerial IT knowledge, interoperable IT infrastructure,
   perceived IT returns on investments (ROI) and formal governance
   mechanisms - on the extent of web-enabled SCM. Our results revealed a
   strong positive influence of supplier synergy, information intensity,
   managerial IT knowledge, inter-operability and formal governance
   mechanisms on the extent of web-enabled SCM. We also found a negative
   association between relative cost-benefit perceptions and the extent of
   web-enabled SCM. Further, we also found strong positive association
   between extent of web-enabled SCM and the benefits realized from SCM
   efforts. We discuss the implications of our results for research and

	abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology surrounded by many promises,
   and potentials to reshape the future of industries and society overall.
   A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional
   computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the
   elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a
   digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side
   by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data
   communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of
   Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next
   generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR),
   Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and
   electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world
   system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and
   predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of
   complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations
   and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology
   faces many challenges including the complexities in effective
   communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train
   Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high
   fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and
   the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation
   measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient
   documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the
   important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling
   technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted. The paper
   provides a deep insight into the technology, lists design goals and
   objectives, highlights design challenges and limitations across
   industries, discusses research and commercial developments, provides its
   applications and use cases, offers case studies in industry,
   infrastructure and healthcare, lists main service providers and
   stakeholders, and covers developments to date, as well as viable
   research dimensions for future developments in DTs.},

	abstract = {For the successful and sustainable deployment and diffusion of smart
   factories, both the capabilities of the adopters who operate the
   factories and the capabilities of the suppliers who supply information
   technology and equipment play very important roles. However, since the
   existing models for diagnosing the capabilities of smart factories are
   mainly focused on evaluating the capabilities of the manufacturing
   companies themselves, such as technological capabilities and digital
   transformation, there are not many models that diagnose the supply
   capabilities of suppliers from the perspective of demand companies.
   Unlike models that diagnose the level of smart factories, when
   diagnosing the capabilities of suppliers, various factors such as supply
   experience and management capabilities must be comprehensively evaluated
   in addition to the capabilities of the company itself. Therefore, this
   study proposes a new model to diagnose the capabilities of suppliers
   from the perspective of adopters who want to build smart factories and
   verifies the validity of the model by applying the model for a pilot
   diagnosis for 32 suppliers. In addition, based on the survey results
   obtained from both adopters and suppliers participating in the pilot
   diagnoses, this study proposes an institutionalization plan for
   capability diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Background There is a consensus among healthcare providers, academics,
   and policy-makers that spiraling demand and diminishing resources are
   threatening the sustainability of the current healthcare system.
   Different telemedicine services are seen as potential solutions to the
   current challenges in healthcare. This paper aims to identify how
   distance monitoring services rendered for patients with chronic
   conditions can affect the escalating demand for healthcare. First, we
   identify how distance monitoring service changes the care delivery
   process using the lens of service cocreation. Next, we analyze how these
   changes can impact healthcare demand using the literature on demand and
   capacity management. Method In this qualitative study, we explore a
   distance monitoring service in a primary healthcare setting in Norway.
   We collected primary data from nurses and general physicians using the
   semi-structured interview technique. We used secondary patient data
   collected from a study conducted to evaluate the distance monitoring
   project. The deductive content analysis method was used to analyze the
   data. Result This study shows that the application of distance
   monitoring services changes the care delivery process by creating new
   activities, new channels for interaction, and new roles for patients,
   general physicians, and nurses. We define patients' roles as proactive
   providers of health information, general physicians' roles as patient
   selectors, and nurses' roles as technical coordinators, data workers,
   and empathetic listeners. Thus, the co-creation aspect of the service
   becomes more prominent demonstrating potential for better management of
   healthcare demand. However, these changes also render the management of
   demand and resources more complex. To reduce the complexities, we
   propose three mechanisms: foreseeing and managing new roles, developing
   capabilities, and adopting a system-wide perspective. Conclusion The
   main contribution of the paper is that it demonstrates that, although
   distance monitoring services have the potential to have a positive
   impact on healthcare demand management, in the absence of adequate
   managerial mechanisms, they can also adversely affect healthcare demand
   management. This study provides a means for practitioners to reflect
   upon and refine the decisions that they make regarding telemedicine
   deployment and resource planning for delivering care.},

	abstract = {Digital technologies are shown to perform a vital role in developing a
   resource-efficient industrial base. The effective adoption of digital
   technologies can help reduce costs and improve the sustainability and
   flexibility of manufacturing industries. However, how digital
   technologies favor the transition towards manufacturing systems has not
   been analyzed in detail yet, so more conceptual and empirical
   investigation is required in this field. This study investigates the
   digital transformation trend in the manufacturing industry by combining
   the bibliometric method with life cycle mode and literature mining. An
   integrated data analysis system (IDAS) is developed, which includes data
   collection, data analysis, and visualization processes. As a result,
   dual-map overlay, keywords clusters, Timeline, and Time zone views are
   visualized to identify the research trend with the three main aspects:
   design, larger integrated circuit, and sustainable manufacturing concept
   evolution. Besides, to recognize potentials for future development of
   the domain, life cycle model-based technological trajectory is
   identified, constructing an information society, the combination of
   tools, and the performance improvement of the whole digital
   transformation. Moreover, in response to sustainable development, a
   system considering business strategies and cultural delivery,
   technological integration, and partner participation and evaluation is
   developed, which could cope with complex manufacturing processes due to

	abstract = {Research summary How firms respond to the emergence of dominant
   platforms that undermine their competitiveness remains a strategic
   puzzle. Our longitudinal study shows how one incumbent, Cisco, responded
   to such a challenge by creating a new platform, Fog, without undermining
   the dominant platform, Cloud, where it played a complementor role. By
   developing a process model we reveal how a firm in a peripheral role in
   a platform ecosystem can reposition itself through a dynamic mix of
   material, symbolic and institutional actions to develop and legitimize
   an alternative platform. This can be done first through symbiosis with
   the dominant platform, then partial competition with it. We theorize the
   value of a mutualistic ``rising tide lifts all boats{''} strategy in
   contrast to hostile ``winner takes all{''} approaches.
   Managerial summary The increasing pervasiveness of digital platforms are
   driving established firms to reboot their strategy to embrace emergent
   forms of competition, collaboration, and mutual coexistence. Fearing
   disruption in their traditional business models, firms may decide to
   jump into the platform game. However, this is not straightforward since
   they do not want to go head-to-head with existing platforms and alienate
   their partners and customers by being perceived as encroaching on their
   turf. We describe one way that established technology firms are
   overcoming this dilemma through a ``rising-tide-lifts-all-boats{''}
   strategy to cultivate new platforms. We show the value of seemingly
   inconsistent and dynamic approaches toward strategic communication and
   investments firm can use to lead new platforms without facing backlash
   from others.},

	abstract = {Supply chain integration (SCI) plays a crucial role in the success of
   healthcare organizations by facilitating strategic collaboration with
   partners and the cooperative management of intra and interorganizational
   processes to achieve effective and efficient flows of information,
   products, and services. Despite the adoption of digital technologies to
   support SCI, evidence suggests that healthcare organizations face
   challenges in integrating their supply chains. To shed light on this
   issue, this research aims to investigate empirically the main obstacles
   hindering health organizations from achieving SCI, despite having
   suitable technology. An exploratory multiple-case study was conducted
   involving the pharmaceutical supply chains of 30 Italian healthcare
   organizations. The study identified seven key barriers to digitally
   enabled SCI in the healthcare field, primarily associated with a lack of
   motivation, resistance to change, a noncost-effective mindset, and a
   lack of initiative from health authorities or dominant players in the
   ecosystem. Contrary to expectations, the availability of financial
   resources and technologies played a minor role, at least in the case
   studies considered. These findings offer insights for healthcare
   organizations seeking to overcome obstacles to achieving SCI.},

	abstract = {This article contributes to the burgeoning literature on digitalization
   and technological upgrading in global value chains (GVCs). It focuses on
   the adoption of additive manufacturing (AM)-a particular type of
   `Industry 4.0' technology-by manufacturing GVCs and its impact on
   process and production upgrade. Drawing on extensive qualitative
   research in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, including
   54 interviews and participant observation firms, it examines the AM
   industry and its adoption in manufacturing firms. The findings
   contribute to existing understandings of technological upgrading in GVCs
   by differentiating between different types of actors within GVCs,
   focusing on produce and process upgrading in lead firms and in original
   equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and lower-tier suppliers. It finds that
   OEM and lower-tier firms are using AM to upgrade and capture value in
   different ways to lead firms, with implications for relationships
   between actors. The paper also highlights the sectoral variation in the
   adoption of AM and reflects on the contemporary and future role of this
   digital technology in manufacturing GVCs.},

	abstract = {Digital supply chains (DSCs) are value-driven and collaborative digital
   systems designed to generate business value for firms through various
   innovative technologies. Today, we are witnessing companies
   transitioning from traditional supply chain models to DSCs through
   digital technologies. The effective selection of digital suppliers
   during these digital transformation processes is a strategic research
   topic. Additionally, factors such as the proliferation of information
   and communication technologies, globalization, and the pandemic have
   contributed to the expansion of e-commerce platforms. In this rapid
   growth phase, identifying the right supplier is crucial for the success
   of e-commerce sites. This study aims to develop an innovative,
   integrated, and comprehensive decision-making methodology to assist
   e-commerce platforms in selecting appropriate suppliers for their DSCs.
   To achieve this, an extended fuzzy VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I
   Komoromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method is tested, where criteria and
   alternative evaluations made by decision-makers (DMs) are characterized
   by interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs). The proposed
   decision mechanism is tested on the DSS problem of an e-commerce
   platform specializing in household products. Findings of the
   application, which uses three experts' opinion to evaluate four digital
   suppliers based on the seven criteria, are discussed to help e-commerce
   sites conduct the DSS process more effectively.},

   integration, virtualization, real-time, automation and
   servitization.Design/methodology/approachPLS-SEM enables a two-stage
   hierarchical latent variable reflective-formative model which was used
   for assessing the effect of organizational determinants on Industry 4.0
   design principles. Five hundred six manufacturing companies constitute
   the effective sample, representing a population of manufacturing
   companies in an industrialized country.FindingsThe findings reveal that
   Industry 4.0 design principles extensively depend on digitalization
   resource availability. At the same time, companies that possess
   digitalization and change management capabilities tend to devote more
   resources to digitalization. Finally, the paper reveals that networking
   and partnership capability is the critical enabler for change management
   and digitalization capabilities.Practical implicationsThe paper provides
   empirical evidence that the successful development of Industry 4.0
   design principles and their underlying integration, virtualization,
   real-time, automation and servitization capabilities are resource
   dependent, requiring significant upfront investment and continuous
   resource allocation. Further, the study implies that companies with

	abstract = {The pressing necessity for digitalisation in industrial plants, driven
   by Industry 4.0 national initiatives and heightened global competition,
   underscores the urgency for companies to initiate digital transformation
   projects. Despite this urgency, the academic literature lacks
   comprehensive guidance on models specifically dedicated to the selection
   of digital technologies. This article addresses this gap by proposing a
   multi-criteria decision-making model, grounded in a methodological
   framework, for the systematic selection of digital technologies in the
   manufacturing sector. The proposed model combines fuzzy logic and the
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and incorporates a well-established
   classification of digital technologies. The model is able to select the
   single best candidate technology as well as the best candidate group of
   technologies that share the same purpose. In this way, the model tries
   to capture the interconnection element that is at the core of the
   digitalisation concept. To test its validity, the model was applied in
   two manufacturing companies operating in distinct production sectors.
   One of these companies was undergoing a digitalisation process in its
   plants, providing an additional basis for comparing the results of the
   proposed model.},

   been extremely dynamic, and the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a strong
   impetus for the development of digitalization. However, there is a large
   difference in the use of e-commerce in European Union (EU) countries.
   The objective of this article is to explain the complex evolution of
   e-commerce in terms of B2C using econometric methods, especially
   regarding Internet purchases made by individuals according to six social
   and technological factors considered basic factors in purchase
   decisions. Thus, we propose a conceptual model for the analysis of
   disparities in Internet purchases, taking into account both factors
   related to demand (consumer) and factors related to supply (supplier).
   Based on the data provided by Eurostat for all 27 EU countries for the
   period 2012-2021, the empirical findings of cluster analysis suggest
   changes in the grouping of countries at the beginning and end of the
   analysed period. Socioeconomic factors that can explain the transition
   of EU states from one group to another in terms of development level of
   Internet purchases by individuals were identified. The results of this
   study can serve as a starting point for future adaptation strategies of
   e-commerce in the context of global economic development with a focus on
   increasing digitisation, the existence of for which a digital

   and technical innovation to revolutionize sustainable resource
   exploitation has become a focal point. The promises of reduced
   environmental impact, heightened efficiency, and improved socio-economic
   outcomes underscore the transformative power that digitalization holds
   for resource management. To this extent, the fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy
   Process (AHP) and fuzzy VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR)
   methods are used to examine challenges and come up with possible
   solutions for the mining sector in Pakistan to adopt digital
   transformation. The study identifies several key challenges,
   sub-challenges, and strategies, giving readers a thorough grasp of
   digital transformation. These challenges and sub-challenges are
   evaluated and ranked according to their relative weights using the fuzzy
   AHP approach. The fuzzy VIKOR method is applied to determine strategies
   that can help overcome these challenges and promote digitalization and
   technological innovation in the sustainable exploitation of natural
   resources. The results of fuzzy AHP show that policy and regulation,
   infrastructure, and human capital are key challenges. The findings of
   fuzzy VIKOR indicate that robust policy development, investment in
   Research and Development (R\&D), and leveraging global trends and

	abstract = {Health 4.0 actively focuses on cold supply chains (CSCs) due to digital
   transformation and technological advancements in refrigeration. With the
   ill effects of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, countries
   globally seek sustainable supply chain management. In this context,
   integrating sustainability with CSCs becomes crucial. Health sectors
   actively consider CSC for their activities. In this context, to gain
   potential suppliers for healthcare management, the present work focuses
   on grading suppliers from the CSC with sustainability factors. Previous
   related studies on sustainable cold chain supplier selection (CSSS) (i)
   have not modeled uncertainty effectively, and (ii) have yet to use any
   approach under fuzzy Z -numbers information. Therefore, this paper
   developed an integrated framework, including the Logarithm Methodology
   of Additive Weights (LMAW) and Technique for Order Preference by
   Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods based on extended fuzzy
   Znumbers. The practicality of the framework is exemplified via a case
   example within the Indian health sector, and results indicate that job
   creation, value price, and productivity via renewable resources are the
   most critical factors. Moreover, regarding the findings, the economic
   dimension is the foremost pillar for effective selection. Sensitivity
   and comparison analyses are performed to understand the efficacy of the
   integrated framework as well. The proposed framework could contribute to
   the relevant literature due to its capacity to cope with complex
   decision -making problems and find many application areas in

	abstract = {Interorganizational trust plays an important role in facilitating
   business relationships, especially for the organizational adoption of
   new services. Prior research suggests that interorganizational trust
   develops when the trustor has adequate confidence in the reliability of
   the trustee's services. Nevertheless, reliability breakdowns are also an
   inevitable part of service provisioning. Such breakdowns are especially
   prominent and visible in the context of platform-based services. Yet
   platform-based services continue to be adopted and used by
   organizational customers. This increased adoption and use of such
   services despite their inconsistent reliability pose the following
   question. How is trust produced in platform-mediated interorganizational
   relationships? To examine this question, I conducted a 20-month field
   study of a cloud computing platform provider and its customers, focusing
   on the practices of trust production in the wake of reliability
   breakdowns. Here, I describe customer concerns about the platform's
   inconsistent reliability that hampered the development of
   interorganizational trust. I then identify four practices of trust work
   enacted by the platform provider to address some of these concerns and
   to co-opt the occupational gatekeepers in customer organizations who are
   responsible for technology adoption decisions. Following this, I
   describe how and why these occupational gatekeepers performed
   justifica-tion work to rationalize the continued use of the platform
   despite its inconsistent reliability. Together, trust work and
   justification work facilitate the coproduction of interorganizational
   trust through normalizing reliability breakdowns as
   ``business-as-usual{''} events. Synthesizing these findings, I developed
   a normalization model of trust production, and discuss the implications
   of normalized trust for platform-mediated interorganizational
   relationships in the digital economy.},

	abstract = {Research Summary In ecosystems, tensions between value creation and
   appropriation can arise when complementors form relationships with a
   partner that benefits from network effects. While creating value
   collectively, these relationships strengthen the network effects, which
   increase the partner's ability to appropriate value. We posit that
   complementors strategize their product offerings to benefit from the
   relationship with the partner while preserving bargaining power by
   keeping relationships with other partners as outside options. We examine
   book publishers' product portfolios in the Amazon Kindle e-book and the
   printed book ecosystems. Our results illuminate specific product
   offering decisions by large publishers that are more protective of the
   printed book ecosystem and less conducive to Kindle's success. This
   research adds to the literature on interorganizational relationships,
   platform ecosystems, and managing digital innovations. Managerial
   Summary How do book publishers deal with Amazon? This paper compares
   book publishers' product offerings on Amazon's Kindle digital platform
   and in the physical print channel. We find that publishers offer high
   demand products as e-books on Kindle to benefit from logistics savings.
   Yet, relative to small publishers, large publishers product decisions
   that support Kindle less, such as withholding some of their greatest
   revenue generating books. Such decisions could both limit Kindle's
   attractiveness to the consumers and preserve the economic viability of
   the print channel as an outside option. These findings improve our
   understanding of how companies can leverage their product portfolios to
   both benefit from digital technology efficiencies and maintain their
   bargaining power vis-a-vis digital platforms.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to propose a guide for the digital
   transformation (4.0) of a manufacturing SME's medium-term production
   planning process, the master production schedule (MPS). A model of the
   current MPS process of a group of SMEs is presented as a starting point
   toward digitization. The current state of this process reveals a lack of
   tools to support decision making and the need to increase the
   reliability of input data and to make the process more agile. Industry
   4.0 technologies and process modeling could increase agility in the
   planning process. However, the digital transformation of medium-term
   planning activities in SMEs has not been studied. To fill this gap, a
   group of six experts was consulted. The novelty of this study was to
   identify the Industry 4.0 technologies that could improve medium-term
   planning and integrate them into a standardized MPS process model. This
   model is an ultimate point of digitization that cannot be achieved
   immediately by any SME, but only after several cycles of planning,
   deployment, and improvement. Therefore, this research also provides a
   method to help SMEs determine how to start the digitization of their MPS
   process.},

	abstract = {The use of big data, artificial intelligence, and new information and
   communication technologies has led to sustainable developments and
   improved business competitiveness. Until recently cloud services were
   classified as having special system requirements for a business
   organization, and was represented by different cloud computing
   architecture layers like infrastructure, platform, or software as a
   service. However, as the environment of IT services undergoes successive
   changes, companies have been required to reconsider their business
   models and consider adopting a cloud computing system, which can bring
   on business achievements and development. Regarding a decision-making
   model for adopting a cloud computing system, this paper analyzes
   critical variables in a hierarchical structure of decision areas:
   technology, organization, and environment, as well as seven factors and
   23 attributes based on underlying decision factors of cloud computing
   adoption by AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and Delphi analysis.
   Furthermore, this research explores a comparative analysis between
   demanders and providers of cloud computing adoption. Resultantly, this
   study suggests several important factors for adopting a cloud computing
   system: top management support, competitive pressure, and compatibility.
   From the demander side, the high priority factor was compatibility and
   competitive pressure; in contrast, related advantage and top management
   support were regarded as priority factors for providers to service their
   cloud computing systems.},

	abstract = {Background Artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare presents
   potential solutions to some of the challenges faced by health systems
   around the world. However, it is well established in implementation and
   innovation research that novel technologies are often resisted by
   healthcare leaders, which contributes to their slow and variable uptake.
   Although research on various stakeholders' perspectives on AI
   implementation has been undertaken, very few studies have investigated
   leaders' perspectives on the issue of AI implementation in healthcare.
   It is essential to understand the perspectives of healthcare leaders,
   because they have a key role in the implementation process of new
   technologies in healthcare. The aim of this study was to explore
   challenges perceived by leaders in a regional Swedish healthcare setting
   concerning the implementation of AI in healthcare. Methods The study
   takes an explorative qualitative approach. Individual, semi-structured
   interviews were conducted from October 2020 to May 2021 with 26
   healthcare leaders. The analysis was performed using qualitative content
   analysis, with an inductive approach. Results The analysis yielded three
   categories, representing three types of challenge perceived to be linked
   with the implementation of AI in healthcare: 1) Conditions external to
   the healthcare system; 2) Capacity for strategic change management; 3)
   Transformation of healthcare professions and healthcare practice.
   Conclusions In conclusion, healthcare leaders highlighted several
   implementation challenges in relation to AI within and beyond the
   healthcare system in general and their organisations in particular. The
   challenges comprised conditions external to the healthcare system,
   internal capacity for strategic change management, along with
   transformation of healthcare professions and healthcare practice. The
   results point to the need to develop implementation strategies across
   healthcare organisations to address challenges to AI-specific capacity
   building. Laws and policies are needed to regulate the design and
   execution of effective AI implementation strategies. There is a need to
   invest time and resources in implementation processes, with
   collaboration across healthcare, county councils, and industry
   partnerships.},

	abstract = {Recent digital transformation initiatives facilitate the access to
   platform-based business models on the demand side as well as enabling
   the necessary proximity to potential customers on the supply side. Due
   to this network connectivity between people, organizations, resources
   and entire industries, value and economic growth can be generated within
   the interactive ecosystem of digital platforms. The special feature of
   this business model is that competitive advantages, contrary to dominant
   paradigms, do not primarily rely on the physical infrastructure or the
   control over scarce and valuable resources. Despite the high practical
   relevance, little systematic knowledge exists on why platform-based
   business models often outperform traditional pipeline businesses in many
   respects. We contribute to this research gap by exploring the critical
   success factors of platform business models. Based on a qualitative
   analysis on digital platforms in the metal and steel industry, we
   identify six key success factors of platform-based business models: We
   relate these success factors to the design of the three dimensions of
   business models as described in the literature: (1) value creation, (2)
   value delivery, and (3) value capture dimensions. Furthermore, our
   analysis could extend these and design features of the business model by
   three additional success factors (4) the promotion and sensitization of
   digital transformation, (5) a suitable platform architecture and
   strategic judgement of platform providers, as well as (6) the promotion
   of a start-up culture as central success factors.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation is a critical way to improve the resilience of
   the manufacturing industry chain. However, the current digitalization of
   manufacturing enterprises lacks upstream and downstream linkage. If the
   level of digitization of upstream and downstream enterprises differs
   significantly, it will increase transaction costs. Digital
   transformation with the help of industrial Internet platform has become
   a trend. For this reason, this study deeply explores the influence
   mechanism of digitalization collaboration of manufacturing enterprises
   under the empowerment of industrial Internet platform. This paper
   constructs a stochastic evolutionary game model with core manufacturing
   enterprise, supplier and local government as the main players. Consider
   stochastic differential equations to analyze the stability conditions of
   game subjects, and explore different incentive mechanisms on enterprise
   strategy. The results show that the data security of the platform and
   the network effect coefficients significantly affect the strategy
   selection results of the players. Additionally, the change of
   environmental noise affects the strategy evolution process of the
   subject, and the supplier strategy is more affected by environmental
   noise compared to the core manufacturing enterprises. Furthermore, the
   dynamic incentive effect of the government is better than the static
   incentive, which can better promote the digital collaboration of
   manufacturing enterprises. Dynamic penalties are less effective than
   static penalties. The study's conclusions can provide a reference for
   the government to implement the gradient digitalization incentive policy
   and provide a theoretical basis for promoting digital collaboration in
   manufacturing enterprises.},

	abstract = {Background: Hospitals worldwide are developing ambitious digital
   transformation programs as part of broader efforts to create digitally
   advanced health care systems. However, there is as yet no consensus on
   how best to characterize and assess digital excellence in hospitals.
   Objective: Our aim was to develop an international agreement on a
   defined set of technological capabilities to assess digital excellence
   in hospitals.
   Methods: We conducted a two-stage international modified electronic
   Delphi (eDelphi) consensus-building exercise, which included a
   qualitative analysis of free-text responses. In total, 31 international
   health informatics experts participated, representing clinical,
   academic, public, and vendor organizations.
   Results: We identified 35 technological capabilities that indicate
   digital excellence in hospitals. These are divided into two categories:
   (a) capabilities within a hospital (n=20) and (b) capabilities enabling
   communication with other parts of the health and social care system, and
   with patients and carers (n=15). The analysis of free-text responses
   pointed to the importance of nontechnological aspects of digitally
   enabled change, including social and organizational factors. Examples
   included an institutional culture characterized by a willingness to
   transform established ways of working and openness to risk-taking. The
   availability of a range of skills within digitization teams, including
   technological, project management and business expertise, and
   availability of resources to support hospital staff, were also
   highlighted.
   Conclusions: We have identified a set of criteria for assessing digital
   excellence in hospitals. Our findings highlight the need to broaden the
   focus from technical functionalities to wider digital transformation
   capabilities.},

	abstract = {As e-commerce has increasingly gained traction in the retail market,
   many traditional ``brick-and-mortar{''} retailers are innovating their
   business models and making the transition towards digital business
   models. While scholars have started to examine the influence of
   digitalization on various business model elements, they have so far paid
   little attention to its implications on the external relationships in
   which firms engage for value creation. Building on a qualitative
   analysis of seventeen interviews, this study develops a two-stage
   framework for the transition to digital business models. In Stage 1,
   retailers collaborate with specialized service providers to implement a
   digital business model. As firms from the retail ecosystem collaborate
   with firms from the digital-service ecosystem to create a value
   proposition for end-customers, a meta-ecosystem emerges. In Stage 2,
   firms (retailers) seek to differentiate themselves from their
   competitors in the meta-ecosystem. Physical interactions with the
   digital service providers, the product suppliers, and the customers are
   a primary means towards this end. Thus, digitalization does not make
   physical interactions and close personal ties obsolete. Our study has
   substantial implications for the academic literature and management
   practice.},

	abstract = {Supplier selection (SS) has emerged as a critical challenge for
   companies aiming to enhance the operational management of their supply
   chains, a task that has grown in complexity with the advent of Industry
   4.0 and the ongoing digital transformation. Recognizing the gaps in
   current literature-specifically, the lack of consideration for
   stakeholders' expectations in guiding SS, as well as the inadequate
   handling of epistemic and stochastic uncertainties-this paper introduces
   a multiple-criteria Quality Function Deployment (QFD)-based model for
   SS. To address epistemic uncertainty, we put forward a novel subjective
   judgment representation method, which is named as linguistic term set
   integrated with discrete subjective probability distribution (LTS-DSPD),
   to enable decision-makers to express their judgments in a manner that is
   both simpler and more nuanced. Furthermore, we also give the elicitation
   methods and computing techniques for LTS-DSPD. Then, we integrate
   stakeholders' requirements, along with their preferences and
   expectations for these requirements to inform and guide SS. To
   effectively operationalize this guidance, we design the QFD-based
   methods to transform stakeholders' inputs into the assessment criteria
   for SS, the weights of criteria, and the expectations for the
   performances of suppliers on each criterion, respectively. To address
   stochastic uncertainty, we have developed an innovative methodology for
   characterizing it, and adopt prospect theory to quantify the overall
   utility of alternative suppliers. The paper concludes with a case study
   to demonstrate its practical application and effectiveness in
   streamlining SS process.},

	abstract = {The digital transformation confronts purchasing and supply management
   (PSM) with numerous new challenges, such as digital procurement objects
   and the information asymmetry between buyers and suppliers. Existing
   approaches contributing to PSM research (e. g., the selection of
   suppliers or the calculation of equilibrium prices) have in common that
   information regarding suppliers (e. g., production costs) must be
   well-known. However, this information is rarely accessible to purchasers
   due to the existing information asymmetry. This problem is addressed by
   a game-theoretical model based on a Stackelberg game to assist PSM in
   dealing with the information advantage of software suppliers. The
   applicability in practice is evaluated by a real-world case study from
   the automotive industry. The results show that the presented model can
   support decision-making in purchasing by a qualitative analysis of
   profit scenarios for different negotiation strategies. The model
   contributes to dismantling the information asymmetry and provides a
   basis for determining negotiation prices, also for digital procurement
   objects. This research motivates both supply and purchase managers to
   jointly optimize their product costs and thus increase their
   competitiveness on the market.},

	abstract = {Purpose of ReviewEmbedding machine learning workflows into real-world
   hospital environments is essential to ensure model alignment with
   clinical workflows and real-world data. Many non-healthcare industries
   undergoing digital transformation have already developed data labelling
   and data quality management services as a vertically integrated business
   process.Recent FindingsIn this paper, we describe our experiences
   developing and implementing a first-of-its-kind clinical NLP (natural
   language processing) service in the National Health Service, United
   Kingdom using parallel harmonised platforms. We report on our work
   developing clinical NLP resources and implementation framework to distil
   expert clinical knowledge into our NLP models. To date, we have amassed
   over 26,086 annotations spanning 556 SNOMED CT concepts working with
   secondary care specialties.SummaryOur integrated language modelling
   service has delivered numerous clinical and operational use-cases using
   named entity recognition (NER). Such services improve efficiency of
   healthcare delivery and drive downstream data-driven technologies. We
   believe it will only be a matter of time before NLP services become an
   integral part of healthcare providers.},

   from in-person interventions, without appropriate consideration of how
   the digital context might differ. Drawing on the wider literature on
   behaviour change intervention development, this research aims to explore
   the digital adaptation process of health behaviour change interventions
   and the specific considerations for digital modes of delivery.DesignA
   qualitative interview study.MethodsInterviews with 15 intervention
   developers/facilitators were analysed using inductive thematic
   analysis.ResultsFindings highlight a continuum of digitalization, where
   variation in technology available and human support influences
   considerations for digital adaptation. `What vs how: ``trying to do the
   impossible{''}' describes the balance between retaining the
   intervention's active ingredients while modifying for digital delivery.
   Through `Trial and error', participants described an iterative process
   based on experience of delivery. `Creating connection and engagement'
   emphasizes the importance of social support and the challenges of
   replicating this.ConclusionsSeveral considerations for digital
   adaptations are proposed including the involvement of end-users
   (facilitators and recipients) during adaptation, the need to understand
   the original intervention and new context for use, and the different

	abstract = {Increasingly, people are turning to social media to express grief. By
   and large, however, the social media community can do little more than
   improvise reactions, not quite sure how to use the old familiar social
   scripts as guides to lending effective support. To examine the role of
   social media in the grieving process, we used a mixed-methods approach:
   12 interviews with ``social media grievers{''} reveal the expectations
   of the bereaved regarding other users' behavior. By way of two online
   experiments with 1058 participants, we tested how these expectations are
   met by the messaging of social media providers in accordance with social
   norm theory. We found that injunctive social norm messages are
   particularly effective, whereas descriptive social norm messages vary in
   their effectiveness, depending on which information is presented and how
   prominently so. What our study shows, then, is that both are potent
   socio-technical tools that can guide users towards more empathetic
   behavior when dealing with the bereaved, so while social media may not
   be a substitute for therapy, they can offer profound comfort for those

   pattern, the automobile industry is facing multiple challenges such as
   the redefinition of new technologies and supply chain changes. The
   purpose of this study is to link big data analytics and artificial
   intelligence (BDA-AI) with digital supply chain transformation (DSCT) by
   taking Chinese automobile industry firms as a sample and to consider the
   role of supply chain internal integration (SCII), supply chain external
   integration (SCEI) and supply chain agility (SCA) between
   them.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 192 Chinese
   firms in the automotive industry and analyzed using partial least
   squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Importance-performance
   map analysis is used to extend the standard results reporting of path
   coefficient estimates in PLS-SEM.FindingsThe results indicate that
   BDA-AI, SCII, SCEI and SCA positively influence DSCT. In addition, this
   study found that SCII, SCEI and SCA play an intermediary role in BDA-AI
   and DSCT.Originality/valueThe paper enriches the research on the
   mechanism of digital resources affecting DSCT and expands the research
   of organizational information processing theory in the context of

	abstract = {Background The global rise in type-2 diabetes (T2D) has prompted the
   development of new digital technologies for diabetes management.
   However, despite the proliferation of digital health companies for T2D
   care, scaling their solutions remains a critical challenge. This study
   investigates the digital transformation of T2D ecosystems and seeks to
   identify key innovation patterns. We examine: (1) What are emerging
   organizations in digital diabetes ecosystems? (2) What are the value
   streams in digital T2D ecosystems? (3) Which innovation patterns are
   present in digital T2D ecosystems?Methods We conducted a literature
   review and market analysis to characterize organizations and value
   streams in T2D ecosystems, pre- and post-digital transformation. We used
   the e3-value methodology to visualize T2D ecosystems (RQ1 and RQ2) and
   conducted expert interviews to identify emerging innovation patterns in
   digital diabetes ecosystems (RQ3).Results Our analyses revealed the
   emergence of eight organization segments in digital diabetes ecosystems:
   real-world evidence analytics, healthcare management platforms, clinical
   decision support, diagnostic and monitoring, digital therapeutics,
   wellness, online community, and online pharmacy (RQ1). Visualizing the
   value streams among these organizations highlights the crucial
   importance of individual health data (RQ2). Furthermore, our analysis
   revealed four major innovation patterns within the digital diabetes
   ecosystem: open ecosystem strategies, outcome-based payment models,
   platformization, and user-centric software (RQ3).Conclusions Our
   findings illustrate the transition from traditional value chains in T2D
   care to platform-based and outcome-oriented models. These innovation
   patterns can inform strategic decisions for companies and healthcare
   providers, potentially helping anticipate new digital trends in diabetes
   care and across other chronic disease ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the digital transformation of the incumbents,
   born-digital small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) embrace digital
   logic in the organization's design, processes, and governance from the
   very start. So far, scholars have focused on the digital transformation
   of the incumbents; thus, little is known about how dynamic capabilities,
   collaborative innovation, and firm performance interact in the context
   of born-digital SMEs-a new generation of digital firms with no legacy of
   the incumbent firm. Therefore, the study's research question is how
   dynamic capabilities and collaborative innovation affect the performance
   of born-digital SMEs. We aim to investigate the impact of the dynamic
   capabilities of born-digital SMEs on their performance when
   collaborative innovations mediate it. The empirical research was based
   on 268 complete viable responses from born-digital SMEs in the U.S.,
   Sweden, and Lithuania. The study results show that dynamic capabilities'
   effect on born-digital SMEs' performance is more potent when mediated by
   collaborative innovations. Furthermore, the study highlights that
   although the impact of dynamic capabilities on partnership networks and
   relational collaboration is significant, only relational collaboration
   significantly affects the performance of born-digital SMEs. Our study
   contributes to the management of technology literature by advancing
   knowledge on dynamic capabilities and collaborative innovation of
   born-digital SMEs. In addition, we are exposing the limited role of
   partnership networks in born-digital SMEs' superior performance and
   spotlighting the significance of relational collaboration-cocreating
   innovative products and services and sharing the cocreated value among
   the relevant partners.},

	abstract = {Purpose
   Industry 4.0 is assumed to yield extensive industry-spanning
   opportunities. However, exploiting these opportunities requires a
   targeted implementation of Industry 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to
   generate a deeper understanding of relevant implementation action.
   Existing recommendations are mostly general, highly aggregated and
   difficult to grasp. Yet, specific and concrete actions that need to be
   taken to accelerate the realization of Industry 4.0 are essential.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The article uses 13 semi-structured in-depth expert interviews as the
   source of empirical data. The interviews were conducted with managers
   from Industry 4.0-experienced German manufacturing companies. All
   interviews are analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
   Findings
   The study reveals relevant and targeted aspects for Industry 4.0
   implementation: the development of Industry 4.0-specific know-how,
   securing financial resources, integrating employees into the
   implementation process and establishing an open-minded and flexible
   corporate culture. Further aspects include comprehensive planning
   processes, cooperation with external partners, proper handling of data
   interfaces, interdisciplinary communication, an adaptable organizational
   structure and data security.
   Research limitations/implications
   The paper is limited to German manufacturing enterprises and should be
   transferred to other industries and countries.
   Practical implications
   The study supports managers to effectively implement Industry 4.0 within
   their organizations and consequently benefit from Industry 4.0 and
   derives recommendations for future research.
   Originality/value
   The paper is among the first to give specific and concrete examples for
   lessons learned from Industry 4.0 implementation, directly obtained from
   industrial application.},

	abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of the automotive industry, firms are
   increasingly turning to advanced Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies to
   drive innovation and sustainability. While I4.0 technologies hold
   immense potential for Business Model Innovation (BMI) and supply chain
   (SC) sustainability, a gap exists in understanding how firms can
   leverage BMI and SCS effectively. This study addresses this gap and
   explores the impact of implementing I4.0 on BMI and its effects on SC
   sustainability. Utilizing an exploratory case study approach, the
   research investigates an Indian automobile SC and highlights how I4.0
   technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, additive manufacturing,
   analytics, and automation contribute to BMI, enhancing operational
   efficiency and SC sustainability. Additionally, the study emphasizes the
   importance of fostering collaboration among SC entities and the need for
   support from large-scale manufacturers for the initial adoption of I4.0
   technologies at the small-scale supplier level. Based on these findings,
   the study develops the `I4.0-enabled BMI for SC Sustainability'
   framework, providing a structured approach for integrating I4.0 and BMI
   to enhance SC sustainability. This research investigates and applies
   Dynamic Capability (DC) theory to examine I4.0 transformations and
   contributes to DC theory by demonstrating how I4.0 facilitates BMI
   across the value chain, leading to improved sustainability performance.},

   grids. In this paper, we identify systematically what particular
   software competencies are required in the future energy systems focusing
   on electricity system smart grids. The realizations of that can then be
   roadmapped to specific software capabilities of the different future
   software houses' across the networks. Our instrumental method is
   software competence development scenario path construction with
   environmental scanning of the related systems elements. The vision of
   future software-enabled smart energy systems with software houses is
   mapped with the already progressing scenarios of energy systems
   transitions on the one hand coupled with the technology foresight of
   software on the other hand. Grounding on the Smart Grid Reference
   Architecture Model (SGAM), it tabulates the distinguished software
   competencies and attributes them to the different partiesincluding
   customers/consumers (Internet of People, IoP)involved in future smart
   energy systems. The resulting designations can then be used to recognize
   and measure the necessary software competencies (e.g., fog computing) in
   order to be able to develop them in-house, or for instance to partner
   with software companies, depending on the future desirability.
   Software-intensive systems development competence becomes one of the key
   success factors for such cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). Further
   futures research work is chartered with the Futures Map frame. This
   paper contributes preliminarily toward that by identifying pictures of

@article{WOS:001012875100050,
	abstract = {Digital transformation is increasingly reliant on service-based
   operations in fog networks. The latter is a geo-dispersed form of the
   cloud, extending resources closer to end-users for improved privacy and
   reduced latency. The dispersion leverages diversity of compute-network
   capacities and energy prices, while promotes the coexistence of multiple
   providers. This drives variation in operational cost, coupled with
   limited information sharing across providers. Consequently, there is a
   critical need for an orchestration solution that preserves autonomy and
   optimizes operational cost across domains, while meeting service
   requirements. This article proposes a novel service-based fog management
   and network orchestrator (sbMANO), which utilizes service metadata in
   enabling multi-provider resource management. The sbMANO is empowered
   with a novel optimization algorithm for service-based joint request
   mapping and response routing. The algorithm acts on partial information
   and preserves the edge for delay-critical services. The performance of
   the algorithm is evaluated analytically for delay-aware and
   delay-agnostic variants. The results show that both achieve near-optimal
   performance in maximizing user satisfaction with minimum operational
   cost. Furthermore, the delay-aware variant outperforms the agnostic
   counterpart, with higher user satisfaction and lower operational cost.},

	abstract = {This research commentary responds to Jiang and Murmann (2022), by
   offering further explanations for the miraculous growth of the digital
   economy in China from both the demand and supply perspectives. To
   complement their views, we identify several additional important
   factors, and classify them in three categories in an explanatory model.
   We believe that factors on the demand side played a primary role, along
   with innovative and entrepreneurial e-commerce service providers on the
   supply side. Infrastructures and government policies provided the
   foundation and a facilitating environment. We conclude that digital
   transformation of traditional industries will become the next wave of
   digital economy, stronger than the previous wave of e-commerce.
   Implications for research and practices are also discussed. In addition,
   we highlight emerging trends and turbulences. In conclusion, despite
   short-term turbulences, we expect that the digital economy in China will
   make big-stride progress in the long term, with strong potential to
   continue its growth.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the present study is to assist academics and
   practitioners in supporting and managing digital production innovation
   projects using managerial controls. The focus is on projects that
   deliver innovations containing new combinations of physical, digital
   and/or cyber-physical components, developed to be used within a
   production system. More specifically, this paper aims to explore the
   applicability of different managerial controls for managing and
   supporting digital production innovation projects, i.e. projects that
   are characterized by high levels of complexity and uncertainty.
   Design/methodology/approach This is a multiple-case study in which
   interview data was collected from five digital production innovation
   projects in two manufacturing firms. The empirical data was used to
   analyze success factors, challenges and obstacles in different phases of
   the studied projects, and to connect these to the application of
   different types of managerial controls. Findings The findings provide an
   increased understanding of who to control, what to control and how to
   control in digital production innovation projects. Research
   limitations/implications This paper is focused specifically on the
   perception of managerial controls in digital production innovation
   projects and has not explicitly focused on manufacturing companies'
   intended usage of managerial controls. This paper's focus on
   manufacturing companies with producing customers and on projects
   developing solutions for their respective customers' production systems
   also encourages further studies at other companies undergoing a
   comparable transition. Given the necessary system perspective on
   managerial controls that is being highlighted, this paper emphasizes
   further research needs on how firms can also apply managerial controls
   to support external collaborations. Practical implications The results
   have a number of managerial implications regarding digital production
   innovation projects. The most prominent findings revealed the importance
   of giving attention to the managerial controls related to the
   decision-making process and the involvement from stakeholders outside
   the organization itself. In particular, it was shown that managerial
   controls securing a more holistic involvement in the decision-making
   process should be applied, and that managerial controls suitable for
   customers and partners need to be developed. Originality/value The study
   is among the first studies to focus on the application and perceived
   effectiveness of managerial controls in digital production innovation
   projects. The ways in which managerial controls are applied to
   collaborations with customers and partners and the ways in which action,
   cultural and personnel controls are combined and aligned to support the
   corporate decision-making process particularly stand out as essential
   for manufacturing companies' Industry 4.0 transition.},

	abstract = {Digital technologies are considered the main drivers for the
   transformation of the manufacturing industry. To effectively navigate
   this wave of transformation, companies need to understand their current
   maturity state regarding implemented technologies and organisational
   processes across various functions. However, many organisations struggle
   to assess their digital status quo. Addressing this gap, this paper
   proposes a framework to help manufacturing companies become aware of
   their digital maturity level and guide them toward a digitalisation
   roadmap. The framework consists of a maturity model, the Digital
   Readiness Assessment MaturitY (DREAMY), inspired by the Capability
   Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), and a digitalisation roadmap tool.
   The research follows the design research methodology, combining a
   literature review, expert consultations, and validation through multiple
   industrial cases to develop, test, and refine the framework. The
   proposed framework enables companies to assess their current digital
   maturity, identify strengths and weaknesses, and discover opportunities
   for improvement, supporting a conscious transition toward Industry 4.0

	abstract = {The global energy transition is increasingly driven by hydrogen energy,
   making digital green innovation crucial for hydrogen energy enterprises.
   This article explores effective strategies for these enterprises to
   select digital green innovation partners and provides actionable
   guidance for their transformation and development. First, an evaluation
   index system is developed using fuzzy set theory, grounded in the
   principles of digital green innovation partner selection for hydrogen
   energy enterprises. Next, a dual-combination weighting evaluation method
   is proposed, integrating combination weighting theory and field theory
   to build a decision model that supports partner selection for these
   companies. The model is then applied in a real-world case analysis of
   Baotailong, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in addressing
   digital green innovation challenges within hydrogen energy enterprises.
   The study concludes that a green and digital transformation approach,
   guided by a fuzzy decision-making model, enables hydrogen energy
   companies to identify suitable innovation partners. This approach not
   only aligns with the broader trends of socio-economic development but
   also enhances the companies' core competitiveness.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Disruptive connected health technologies, or digitalization,
   are suggested to tackle the healthcare challenges and transform
   traditional care models. In Finland, the transformation is manifested by
   the development of various digital hospitals and citizen-centric care
   models that foster self-care by utilizing connected health technologies.
   In this paper we introduce qualitative research that uses social
   practice theory in order to understand how connected health technologies
   shape a pediatric day surgery practice in future digital hospitals.
   Major improvement needs were identified to center on discursive actions
   (i.e., communication that occurs between health professionals and
   patients), since hospital IT systems, data exchange, and internal and
   external communication were found to not support pediatric surgery
   practice as expected. To improve the current situation, we found out
   that there is a need to change the patient role to be more active,
   creating data that health professionals could use through their own
   patient record systems. Connected health solutions allow this type of
   interaction between things (i.e., communication through mobile apps,
   medical devices, etc.) and agents (i.e., health professionals). There is
   an urgent need to improve communication channels such as Chat, WhatsApp,
   and mobile applications that gather all necessary information and
   instructions from patients before and after the surgery. However, these
   solutions cannot be co-created separately from the clinical decision
   systems that allow discursive actions among healthcare professionals.
   These solutions, e.g. mobile applications designed to support patients
   going through the surgery practice, will also significantly impact and
   change pediatric surgery practice at hospitals.},

	abstract = {This study delves into the dynamics of pragmatic interoperability,
   focusing on the case of a digital ecosystem in India -the eKrishi
   platform-which combines of industry 4.0 technologies with human-centric
   principles. Through qualitative analysis, we unveil the motivations
   shaping system and business-level interoperability alignment. We found
   that three categories of sustainability metrics-socio-economic,
   socio-ecological, and eco-efficiency- are driven by diverse pragmatic
   views. Furthermore, we found that system-level alignment is driven by
   actors' defensive strategy for compliance and standardization, while
   business level interoperability is underpinned by actors' offensive
   strategy for social and economic innovation. The study introduces a 2 x
   2 alignment framework-corporate citizenship, regulatory stewardship,
   corporate stewardship, and value chain stewardship-offering nuanced
   insights. By aligning systems and business motives for pragmatic
   interoperability, we contribute towards theory building on
   interoperability and provide practical implications for guiding
   stakeholder alignment in Industry 4.0 initiatives.},

	abstract = {Background: Value-Based Care (VBC) is being discussed to provide better
   outcomes to patients, with an aim to reimburse healthcare providers
   (HCPs) based on the quality of care they deliver. Little is known about
   German HCPs' knowledge of VBC. This study aims to investigate the
   knowledge of HCPs of VBC and to identify potential needs for further
   education toward implementation of VBC in Germany. Methods: For evidence
   generation, we performed a literature search and conducted an online
   survey among HCPs at 89 hospitals across Germany. The questionnaire was
   based on published evidence and co-developed with an expert panel using
   a mixed methods approach. Results: We found HCPs to believe that VBC is
   more applicable in surgery than internal medicine and that well-defined
   cycles of care are essential for its application. HCPs believe that VBC
   can reduce health care costs significantly. However, they also assume
   that implementing VBC will be challenging. Conclusions: The concept in
   general is well perceived, however, HCPs do not want to participate in
   any financial risk sharing. Installing an authority/independent agency
   that measures achieved value, digital transformation, and that improves
   the transition between the inpatient and the outpatient sectors are top
   interests of HCPs.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges for the U.S.
   healthcare system due to the staggering mismatch between healthcare
   system capacity and patient demand.
   The healthcare industry has been a relatively slow adopter of digital
   innovation due to the conventional belief that humans need to be at the
   center of healthcare delivery tasks. However, in the setting of the
   COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI) may be used to carry out
   specific tasks such as pre-hospital triage and enable clinicians to
   deliver care at scale.
   Recognizing that the majority of COVID-19 cases are mild and do not
   require hospitalization, Partners HealthCare (now Mass General Brigham)
   implemented a digitally-automated pre-hospital triage solution to direct
   patients to the appropriate care setting before they showed up at the
   emergency department and clinics, which would otherwise consume
   resources, expose other patients and staff to potential viral
   transmission, and further exacerbate supply-and-demand mismatching.
   Although the use of AI has been well-established in other industries to
   optimize supply and demand matching, the introduction of AI to perform
   tasks remotely that were traditionally performed in-person by clinical
   staff represents a significant milestone in healthcare operations
   strategy.},

	abstract = {Current legislation and market dynamics require and encourage systems to
   become more open and interoperable. Given this shift, the challenge
   arises as to how service providers can navigate such environments and
   whether and how known platform economics are affected by that change. In
   this context, our work investigates behavior when users interact with
   services in highly interoperable environments, examining the influence
   of service attributes and platform economics on service selection and
   switching decisions, with a focus on the role of transaction cost and
   time, onboarding time, privacy, ownership, and community. For this
   purpose, we designed and conducted an extensive survey study with more
   than 500 respondents that combined a conjoint study with an experimental
   part on switching scenarios. Our findings suggest that transaction
   features such as cost, time, and privacy are the main factors in service
   selection with part-worth utilities being 2.1 to 14.7 times higher than
   non-transactional features. Additionally, building a strong community
   and offering ownership opportunities to users are effective strategies
   for customer retention. Further, we observe that rational choice theory
   does not explain switching decisions in many cases. Our study has
   important implications for both industry practitioners and policymakers.
   Practitioners can use our results to carefully manage effective customer
   retention strategies, while policymakers can use them to better regulate
   digital markets.},

	abstract = {The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) is the first trade
   agreement that comprehensively deals with contemporary policy issues in
   digital trade. It introduces new disciplines on issues such as
   cross-border data flows, online privacy, network neutrality,
   cybersecurity, regulation of spam, and safe harbour protection for
   internet intermediaries. These provisions are atypical of trade
   agreements, and are particularly significant as they have a direct
   impact on internet policy. In this article, I evaluate these new
   disciplines in the TPP to assess the extent to which the TPP is suitably
   placed in the internet eco-system. After a comprehensive legal
   assessment of these disciplines, I argue that the TPP does not
   effectively fit into the broader internet ecosystem, as it fails to
   synergize the goal of trade liberalization with important internet
   policy concerns such as facilitating trust of internet users and digital
   innovation. However, despite its deficiencies, the TPP sets a new
   benchmark for rules on digital trade, as its provisions address several
   contemporary issues in the digital economy. Therefore, the provisions on
   digital trade within the TPP will be instrumental in future negotiations
   at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other regional bodies. More
   importantly, the TPP is a reminder of the increasing significance of
   trade agreements in influencing critical aspects of internet policy.
   Particularly, in developing rules on digital trade that affect issues
   such as cross-border data flows, online privacy and consumer protection,
   net neutrality and cybersecurity, trade negotiators/lawyers need to
   comprehensively assess the relevance of these rules in the
   liberalization of digital trade, and its broader impact on the internet
   ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHealth) implementation is crucial for
   developing sustainable healthcare systems, but it faces the challenge of
   user acceptance. Extending traditional acceptance models allows for the
   cognitive, emotional and social aspects of engaging with mHealth to be
   captured, creating a more comprehensive understanding of users'
   intentions to use it in the future. User-centred intervention studies
   based on users' real experiences with mHealth are essential for accurate
   assessments and for improving upon studies that rely merely on
   anticipated mHealth use. Methods: An intervention study was conducted
   with 103 patients with at least one chronic condition (type 2 diabetes
   and/or arterial hypertension) who had used an mHealth service for three
   months. They were recruited through purposive sampling at a community
   health centre in Slovenia. Path analysis was applied to the survey data
   collected after a three-month testing period to validate an explanatory
   model with eight hypotheses. Results: The intensity of mHealth use
   affected usability, which in turn affected acceptability, the
   psychosocial impacts of engagement with mHealth and intention for future
   use. The results showed that the intensity of mHealth use did not affect
   mHealth acceptability. Likewise, acceptability did not affect the
   psychosocial impacts of engagement with mHealth or the intention for its
   future use. Notably, perceptions of the psychosocial impacts of mHealth
   had no significant effect on the intention for future use. Conclusion:
   Usability and intensity of use play a central role in the
   post-intervention usage of mHealth, offering valuable insights for
   policymakers and healthcare providers involved in the delivery of
   mHealth-based treatment to patients with chronic diseases.},

	abstract = {BackgroundThe healthcare industry is rapidly evolving due to digital
   innovation and technological advancements. The increasing volume of
   healthcare data necessitates efficient analytical methods to extract
   meaningful insights. Traditional health data analysis platforms
   primarily focus on data collection, aggregation, processing, analysis,
   visualisation, and interpretation. However, challenges remain in
   optimising these processes for effective disease prediction and
   decision-making.MethodsThis study proposes the k-means termite
   clustering model (KTCM) as a novel optimisation approach for healthcare
   data analysis. The model integrates graph reduction techniques for data
   preprocessing, followed by storage in a clinical database. A mining
   algorithm is employed to analyse the processed data, enhancing
   predictive accuracy. Healthcare professionals receive training on
   standardised prediction methodologies to refine disease forecasting
   based on historical benchmarks. The model's performance is evaluated
   using statistical metrics, including R-2, REMS, MSE, MAE and
   MAPE.ResultsThe proposed KTCM model demonstrates superior predictive
   performance, achieving an R-2 value of 99.7\%, surpassing other existing
   methods. The advanced clustering and optimisation techniques improve the
   accuracy and efficiency of disease prediction, thereby aiding healthcare
   professionals in making informed decisions.ConclusionThe KTCM approach
   significantly enhances healthcare data analysis by optimising disease
   prediction through efficient clustering and mining techniques. The
   model's high accuracy and improved parameter optimisation validate its
   effectiveness in clinical decision support. Future work may explore
   further refinements in algorithmic performance and real-time

	abstract = {While intelligent manufacturing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for
   industrial upgrading in emerging economies, its impact on firms'
   financial behavior, particularly trade credit decisions, remains
   unexplored. Prior research has focused primarily on how intelligent
   manufacturing affects operational efficiency and innovation performance,
   overlooking its potential role in reshaping supply chain financing
   patterns. This study addresses this gap by examining the causal
   relationship between intelligent manufacturing and firm trade credit
   dynamics. Employing a difference-in-differences (DID) approach with a
   comprehensive dataset of 2022 Chinese A-share manufacturing firms from
   2010 to 2020, we document that intelligent manufacturing adopters
   significantly increase their trade credit provision while reducing trade
   credit financing from suppliers. Specifically, the ratio of trade credit
   provided to customers increases by 2.87\% while trade credit received
   from suppliers decreases by 2.55\%. Through extensive mechanism tests
   and heterogeneity analyses, we reveal that this effect operates
   primarily through the alleviation of financing constraints, with

	abstract = {The dramatic growth in the rate of diabetes prompts serious debates
   about awareness, early diagnosis, and care interventions. This Viewpoint
   aims to explore, from the perspectives of healthcare sector
   representatives, what challenges and difficulties they face in dealing
   with diabetes and how these can be overcome. We applied the World Caf \&
   eacute; method for group discussions, which enabled us to bring together
   50 stakeholders. They identified challenges at institutional and
   structural levels under the concepts of awareness, digitalisation, and
   new forms of care and shared their suggestions for feasible solutions.
   We learned there is a need for a diabetes map of Germany to identify
   risk groups and that hybrid solutions should be implemented for
   treatment, care, prevention, and early diagnosis, considering digital
   infrastructure. Also, the demand for digital innovation in the
   healthcare system raised concerns about information transparency and
   data management.
   Use of transparent information and data management policies builds a
   stronger sense of trust between beneficiaries and service
   providers.Digital innovations in healthcare systems require hybrid
   solutions in the short-term.Social media campaigns can be effective for
   raising awareness and better understanding of diabetes.},

	abstract = {This study aims to explore the impact of healthcare digitalization on
   smart hospital project financing (PF) fostered by pay-for-performance
   (P4P) incentives. Digital platforms are a technology-enabled business
   model that facilitates exchanges between interacting agents. They
   represent a bridging link among disconnected nodes, improving the
   scalable value of networks. Application to healthcare public-private
   partnerships (PPPs) is significant due to the consistency of digital
   platforms with health issues and the complexity of the stakeholder's
   interaction. In infrastructural PPPs, public and private players
   cooperate, usually following PF patterns. This relationship is
   complemented by digitized supply chains and is increasingly
   patient-centric. This paper reviews the literature, analyzes some supply
   chain bottlenecks, addresses solutions concerning the networking effects
   of platforms to improve PPP interactions, and investigates the
   cost-benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case. Whereas
   diagnostic or infrastructural technology is an expensive investment with
   long-term payback, leapfrogging digital applications reduce contingent
   costs. ``Digital{''} savings can be shared by key stakeholders with P4P
   schemes, incentivizing value co-creation patterns. Efficient sharing may
   apply network theory to a comprehensive PPP ecosystem where stakeholding
   nodes are digitally connected. This innovative approach improves
   stakeholder relationships, which are re-engineered around digital
   platforms that enhance patient-centered satisfaction and sustainability.
   Digital technologies are useful even for infectious disease
   surveillance, like that of the coronavirus pandemic, for supporting
   massive healthcare intervention, decongesting hospitals, and providing
   timely big data.},

	abstract = {In entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), geographical and contextual factors
   play a big role in shaping the knowledge bases for digital innovation.
   While cities around the world compete to be perceived as successful

   study utilizes a bibliometric analysis of secondary data in combination
   with exploratory stakeholder interviews conducted for both cities.
   Findings underline the critical role of experimental knowledge in
   driving the momentum of the EEs and the supporting role of policies
   imprinting knowledge practices. The paper shows how the dynamics of EEs

	abstract = {Effective supplier management is critical for an enterprise's success,
   as supplier procurement accounts for up to approximately 70\% to 80\% of
   total manufacturing costs. Correct supplier selection can ensure the
   competi-tiveness of the enterprise and contribute to supply chain
   integration and innovation. In recent years, supplier evaluation
   frameworks based on Industry 4.0 concepts have contributed to the
   development of the industry. However, the novel concepts of Industry 5.0
   require examination from a people-oriented and sustainable perspective.
   Unfortunately, at the present time, supplier evaluation frameworks based
   on Industry 5.0 are lacking. Therefore, the primary task of this study
   is to develop a novel and comprehensive supplier evaluation framework
   for the Industry 5.0 era. This study proposes a data-driven decision
   support system to execute the supplier evaluation process. First,
   variable precision-dominance-based rough set approach (VC-DRSA) is
   applied to extract the core criteria, to remove the noise factors and to
   generate decision rules for the decision-makers' reference. Second, the
   criterion importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) approach
   is adopted to obtain the dependency weights of the core criteria and
   their ranking. Finally, a modified classifiable technique for order
   preference by similarity to ideal solution (CTOPSIS) is used to
   integrate the final performance values of suppliers when new alternative
   suppliers are added. The research concept is in line with the conception
   of data-driven decision support in business intelligence and does not
   rely on the subjective judgments and opinions of experts. Data provided
   by a multinational medical equipment manufacturer are used as an example
   to demon-strate the proposed model. VC-DRSA retains nine core criteria
   from the original twenty criteria, which greatly reduces the labor and
   cost of supplier audits. In addition, the CRITIC results show that
   digital transformation, real-time information sharing, and
   organizational culture transformation are the three main factors
   affecting the development of enterprises towards Industry 5.0. The
   results show that CTOPSIS can be used to quickly assess the ratings of
   new alternative suppliers are listed.},

   education. To date, most research has focused on visitors' experiences
   with and museums' management of digital museum education. This leaves
   the voice of museum educators underresearched. Museum educators,
   however, are the main drivers of this digital transformation. Therefore,
   this study explores the voice of museum educators. Semi-structured
   online interviews were conducted with twelve museum educators working in
   museums in the Brussels Capital Region (Belgium). We identified
   opportunities and challenges of digital museum education related to
   three key stakeholders of museums, i.e. museum visitors, museum
   educators, and museum institutions. Partnerships seemed key to overcome
   challenges in developing digital museum education. By exploring museum
   educators' experiences, we provide a broader and multi-layered

   heart failure patients. For maximum benefit from this technology, we
   need to incorporate design thinking to deliver good patient experience
   and smooth, pain-free integration in their daily routine. Codevelopment
   of innovative solutions should be undertaken with multistakeholder
   collaboration, such as payers, providers, patients, regulators,
   industry, and academia. Privacy and security of data and promotion of
   ethical use for the benefit of patients are integral to their successful
   implementation. Early warning systems, which use digital voice and PCG
   biomarkers for heart failure care, have great potential in prompt
   identification of at-risk patients and targeting timely appropriate
   interventions. CAI, voice technology, voice and PCG analytics, is an

	abstract = {Amid rising uncertainty in the global economy and unprecedented economic
   disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of supply chain
   resilience has gained increasing popularity in ASEAN and the EU.
   However, by comparing their paths to resilient supply chains, this
   article argues that while both organizations regard resilience as a
   departure from past doctrines of pure economic efficiency, each has a
   different understanding of and approach to supply chain resilience.
   While for ASEAN, supply chain resilience is meant to reconcile inward-
   and outward-looking dimensions to support ASEAN competitiveness, within
   the EU, resilience is associated with the search for strategic autonomy
   with an internal focus. Despite these differences, both groups regard
   sustainability and digital transformation as crucial components of

	abstract = {Purpose Cost transparency is of central importance to reach a consensus
   between supply chain partners. The purpose of this paper is to
   contribute to the instrument of cost analysis which supports the link
   between buyers and suppliers. Design/methodology/approach Based on a
   detailed literature review in the area of cost analysis and purchasing,
   intelligent decision support systems for cost estimation are identified.
   Subsequently, expert interviews are conducted to determine the
   application possibilities for managers. The application potential is
   derived from the synthesis of motivation, identified applications and
   challenges in the industry. Management recommendations are to be derived
   by bringing together scientific and practical approaches in the
   industry. Findings On the one hand, the results of this study show that
   machine learning (ML) is a complex technology that poses many challenges
   for cost and purchasing managers. On the other hand, ML methods,
   especially in combination with expert knowledge and other analytical
   methods, offer immense added value for cost analysis in purchasing.
   Originality/value Digital transformation allows to facilitate the cost
   calculation process in purchasing decisions. In this context, the
   application of ML approaches has gained increased attention. While such
   approaches can lead to high cost reductions on the side of both
   suppliers and buyers, an intelligent cost analysis is very demanding.},

	abstract = {The increasing digitalisation of healthcare has created a pressing need
   for health professionals to develop robust digital skills. This paper
   explores the imperative of equipping health professionals with the
   necessary digital proficiency to enhance their daily workflows and
   improve patient care. The expanding use of digital technologies,
   including electronic health records, telehealth, and artificial
   intelligence, has transformed the healthcare landscape. However, the
   adoption of these technologies has been hindered by barriers, such as a
   lack of interoperability and hesitancy among healthcare providers. To
   address these challenges, this paper argues that digital skill
   development must be a core component of healthcare education and
   professional training. Medical schools and healthcare organisations must
   prioritise the integration of digital health curricula and continuous
   learning opportunities to ensure that the next generation of healthcare
   providers is well-equipped to navigate the digital healthcare ecosystem.
   Additionally, this paper highlights the importance of fostering a
   culture of digital innovation and collaboration within healthcare
   settings. By empowering health professionals to actively participate in
   the development and testing of new digital health applications, the

	abstract = {Hackathons quick prototyping events to create technical innovations for
   perceived challenges have become an important means to foster
   innovation, entrepreneurship and the start-up economy in smart cities.
   Typically such events are organized by companies working in partnership
   with city administrations, and are predominately attended by technically
   literate participants who work in the tech sector. In this paper, we
   consider and critique the rationalities and practices of
   commercially-oriented hackathons. Drawing on Gabriel Tarde and recent
   re-engagement of his ideas, we analyse the spatiotemporal practices that
   modulate the passion and imitation in and around hackathons. We document
   how hackathon schedules and spaces are arranged in ways to extend but
   also exploit participants' passions for digital innovation and
   entrepreneurship, act as sites of ups killing and career progression,
   but also reproduce neoliberal and entrepreneurial labour and urban
   development. We argue that hackathons interpellate by attracting
   participants to desire and believe in entrepreneurial life and

	abstract = {Recent economic transformations have forced companies to redefine their
   value propositions, increasing traditional product offerings with
   supplementary services-the so-called Product-Service System (PSS). Among
   them, the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies is very common. However,
   the directions that companies are undertaking to offer new value to
   their customers in the Industry 4.0 have not yet been investigated in
   detail. Based on a focus group, this paper contributes to this
   understanding by identifying the main trajectories that would shape a
   future scenario in which PSS and Industry 4.0 would merge. In addition,
   future research directions addressing (a) the transformation of the PSS
   value chain into a PSS ecosystem, (b) the transformation inside a single
   company towards becoming a PSS provider, and (c) the digital
   transformation of the traditional PSS business model are identified.},

	abstract = {Digital collaboration capability, which refers to a company's ability to
   share and coordinate information with partners via digital channels, is
   one of the primary organizational capabilities that helps companies gain
   differentiation advantages. However, there is still no consensus on how
   companies should leverage digital collaboration capability to improve
   their services. To fill this gap, we develop a moderated mediation model
   from the perspective of absorptive capacity. Through the survey of 205
   Chinese information technology (IT) companies, we find that potential
   absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity fully mediate the
   positive relationship between digital collaboration capability and
   service innovation, suggesting that digital collaboration capability can
   improve a company's services only when it is translated into absorptive
   capability. More interestingly, technological turbulence strengthens the
   mediation effect of absorptive capacity, implying that a high-level
   technical environment better facilitates companies to absorb information
   and knowledge from different digital channels and subsequently improves
   service innovation. We contribute to the existing digital innovation
   literature by articulating the moderated mediation mechanisms through
   which digital collaboration capability influences service innovation.
   Our study also provides managerial implications for companies on how to
   boost service innovation in the digital era.},

	abstract = {Circular Economy (CE) adoption in Indian SMEs is still nascent,
   irrespective of various initiatives, policies, and trans-national
   strategic partnerships of the Indian government. The existing research
   has outlined the benefits of CE adoption within organisations
   (regardless of the size and sector) to achieve sustainable business
   performance in emerging markets. This paper employs resource-based view
   as a theoretical lens to examine the factors influencing and inhibiting
   CE adoption in Indian manufacturing and process-based SMEs by conducting
   twelve case-studies. The within and cross-case analysis shows that lack
   of business process analysis, skills and expertise, digital
   transformation and multi-stakeholder cooperation within the supply chain
   inhibits CE adoption, while government initiatives, competitive
   advantage, environmental regulation, and customer pressure are the
   drivers. The study proposes a CE implementation guide comprising six
   principles for the SMEs' managers in India to achieve resource
   efficiency, cost savings, multi-stakeholder collaboration and

	abstract = {Purpose - Digitalization encourages the manufacturer to engage in
   inter-organizational technological activities (i.e. supplier IT
   integration and supply visibility) with its major supplier, which
   influences supply chain (SC) governance. This study tests a moderated
   mediation model that considers supplier IT integration and supply
   visibility as mediators between supply-side digitalization and supplier
   opportunism, and relational ties as a moderator in the relationship
   between inter-organizational technological activities and supplier
   opportunism.
   Design/methodology/approach - Ordinary least square (OLS) regression is
   used to examine data from 200 firms in China describing their supply
   chain management (SCM) practices and perceived relationships with their
   major suppliers.
   Findings - Supply-side digitalization is positively related to supplier
   IT integration and supply visibility. Supply-side digitalization has a
   positive indirect effect on supplier opportunism through supplier IT
   integration but a negative indirect effect through supply visibility.
   Relational ties weaken the positive effect of supplier IT integration
   and the positive indirect effect of supply-side digitalization on
   supplier opportunism. Relational ties also weaken the negative effect of
   supply visibility and the negative indirect effect of supply-side
   digitalization on supplier opportunism.
   Originality/value - This study enriches understanding of SC governance
   in the digital age by empirically confirming that digital transformation
   brings both challenges and opportunities to SC governance and by
   clarifying the interplay of relational governance and technological
   activities. In addition, this study contributes to the SC digitalization
   literature by empirically validating the role of digitalization in
   promoting interorganizational technological activities, as well as by
   revealing its potential dark side.},

	abstract = {Purpose With the growing trend of digital technology in global supply
   chains, how to manage global supply chain relationships under digital
   transformation becomes a critical issue. However, academic research in
   this area is sparse. This study develops and tests a theoretical
   framework of the moderating effect of virtual integration on
   interorganziational governance in international customer supplier
   relationships. Design/methodology/approach We chose to examine the
   specific cross-border relationships between Taiwanese suppliers and
   their international OEMs because Taiwanese suppliers tend to be smaller
   than their international OEM customers, and thus their relationships
   usually show power asymmetry. Furthermore, the Taiwanese electronics
   industry offers a valuable empirical context because its industry
   members have served as pioneers in information technology development,
   have championed cross-border relationships with US and European industry
   leaders and are actively participating in the world economy Findings Our
   empirical findings indicate that virtual integration will strengthen the
   effect contractual governance on relationship performance. However, the
   moderating effect of virtual integration on relational governance is not
   significant. The paper discusses the theoretical and managerial
   implications in the end. Originality/value This study contributes to
   interorganizational governance literature in international contexts.
   Previous work on international relationship management has focused much
   on MNE buyers' perspectives and paid little attention to the suppliers'
   perspectives. This study extends this stream of research by empirically
   examining how suppliers can govern their MNEs' customers via different
   governance mechanisms. The findings extend literature on virtual
   integration and show that virtual integration can complement detailed
   contract and safeguard opportunism, which in turn, enhance relationship
   performance in international customer-supplier relationships.},

	abstract = {Background Digital health is being used as an accelerator to improve the
   traditional healthcare system, aiding countries in achieving their
   sustainable development goals. Burkina Faso aims to harmonize its
   digital health interventions to guide its digital health strategy for
   the coming years. The current assessment represents upstream work to
   steer the development of this strategic plan.Methods This was a
   quantitative, descriptive study conducted between September 2022 and
   April 2023. It involved a two-part survey: a self-administered
   questionnaire distributed to healthcare information managers in
   facilities, and direct interviews conducted with software developers.
   This was complemented by a documentary review of the country's strategic
   and standards documents on digital transformation.Results Burkina Faso
   possesses a relatively comprehensive collection of governance documents
   pertaining to digital transformation. The study identified a total of 35
   digital health interventions. Analysis showed that 89\% of funding
   originated from technical and financial partners as well as the private
   sector. While the use of open-source technologies for the development of
   the applications, software, or platforms used to implement these digital
   health interventions is well established (77\%), there remains a
   deficiency in the integration of data from different platforms.
   Furthermore, the classification of digital health interventions revealed
   an uneven distribution between the different elements across domains:
   the health system, the classification of digital health interventions
   (DHI), and the subsystems of the National Health Information System
   (NHIS). Most digital health intervention projects are still in the pilot
   phase (66\%), with isolated electronic patient record initiatives
   remaining incomplete. Within the public sector, these records typically
   take the form of electronic registers or isolated specialty records in a
   hospital. Within the private sector, tool implementation varies based on
   expressed needs. Challenges persist in adhering to interoperability
   norms and standards during tool design, with minimal utilization of the
   data generated by the implemented tools.Conclusion This study provides
   an insightful overview of the digital health environment in Burkina Faso
   and highlights significant challenges regarding intervention strategies.
   The findings serve as a foundational resource for developing the digital
   health strategic plan. By addressing the identified shortcomings, this
   plan will provide a framework for guiding future digital health
   initiatives effectively.},

	abstract = {Through a multiple-case study of seven German providers, we explore the
   architecture of commercial offerings of consumer experiences, such as
   wine-tastings, craft workshops, or wellness activities, which have both
   digital and physical components. Physical-digital experiences offer
   participants an opportunity to encounter many different sensations of an
   experience, as not all (e.g. taste, smell, touch) can be converted to
   digital form and not all are possible to experience physically (e.g.
   visual depictions of distant lands). Our empirical study shows that
   experience providers combine both physical and digital offering
   architectures by augmenting, substituting, porting, and excluding
   physical and digital components, a process that changes the value these
   experiences create for consumers and provides new means by which
   providers capture value from these offerings. We develop a theoretical
   model that explains value creation and value capture through the design
   and provision of physical-digital experiential consumer offerings that
   leverage physical-digital hybridity at multiple levels to enhance
   existing or generate new value pathways.},

	abstract = {While it is often claimed that the pace of digital transformation is
   such that its own, often glacial changes do not allow the state to catch
   up, we argue that technological companies, with the help of some state
   actors, have been slowing the state down. To capture this phenomenon, we
   introduce the notion of stalling strategies. We argue that stalling
   strategies have allowed digital platforms to create time that they have
   spent generating revenue and accumulating platform power, which later
   protected them from state actions. Drawing on a case study of Uber in
   Poland and a number of shadow cases, we distinguish five stalling
   strategies: reinventing classifications, dragging out court proceedings,
   stealing the time of street-level bureaucrats, delaying new regulations,
   and taking time to (not) comply. By analyzing stalling strategies, this
   article contributes to discussions about the politics of platform
   capitalism, the temporality of digitalization, and institutional drift.},

	abstract = {This study investigates key stakeholder factors that contribute to big
   data organizational culture, leading to the adoption of digitalization
   strategy in the hospitality industry. It also determines the interaction
   between big data organizational culture and leader commitment in
   influencing digitalization strategy adoption. Following a pilot test to
   ensure the suitability of the measures, a three-wave survey was
   conducted to obtain data from 438 hotels in an emerging economy.
   Structural equation modeling results reveal that three stakeholder
   factors (i.e., customer orientation, supplier cooperation, and employee
   information technology skills) positively affect big data organizational
   culture, which in turn enhances the adoption of digitalization
   strategies. Moreover, leader commitment moderates the link between big
   data organizational culture and digitalization strategy adoption. These
   findings advance the extant literature on hospitality digital
   transformation and digitalization strategy. They also provide important
   implications for hospitality managers in understanding and promoting big

	abstract = {This study explores relationships among various aspects of Innovation
   Intermediaries' (IIs) business models and their intention to provide
   digital and data-enabled services to their members/customers. Using
   mixed research methods with data collected from Danish IIs, we find that
   IIs' current use level of digital resources has a positive relationship
   with their intention of offering digital and data services, while the
   level of existing digital services demotivates or prevents IIs from
   providing them. We also find that the breadth of IIs' customers and
   partnerships is not directly associated with their intention to offer
   more digital services in the future. These findings are enriched with
   nuanced insights from a follow-up qualitative study showing that
   strategic partners do not provide the required support for
   intermediaries to develop and provide digital offerings. Instead, IIs
   rely on system integrators to equip themselves with the needed digital
   capacity to support their members/customers. The study contributes to
   the understanding of IIs' business models linked to their service
   catalogue, particularly on digital offerings and their function as
   digitalization champions in a shifting paradigm of industrial digital
   transformation. Furthermore, it adds knowledge about open innovation by
   researching service offerings and relevant resources and capabilities of

	abstract = {Digital transformation in health care has a lot of opportunities to
   improve access and quality of care. However, in reality not all
   individuals and communities are benefiting equally from these
   innovations. People in vulnerable conditions, already in need of more
   care and support, are often not participating in digital health
   programs. Fortunately, numerous initiatives worldwide are committed to
   make digital health accessible to all citizens, stimulating the
   long-cherished global pursuit of universal health coverage.
   Unfortunately initiatives are not always familiar with each other and
   miss connection to jointly make a significant positive impact. To reach
   universal health coverage via digital health it is necessary to
   facilitate mutual knowledge exchange, both globally and locally, to link
   initiatives and apply academic knowledge into practice. This will
   support policymakers, health care providers and other stakeholders to

	abstract = {Purpose: Entrepreneurial universities can bridge innovation and the
   entrepreneurial ecosystems to emerge as knowledge providers and
   capability aggregators that catalyse regional and national economic and
   social development. Given their prominent role in society, this study
   seeks to understand how entrepreneurial teaching and learning, preparing
   and supporting entrepreneurs, and digital transformation and
   capabilities (HEInnovate dimensions) influence the development of
   graduates' entrepreneurial activities. Design/methodology/approach:
   Based on 13 interviews with graduate entrepreneurs, this study reveals
   the multiple aspects involved in the university entrepreneurial
   structures approached by the dimension of the HEInnovate scale.
   Findings: The findings convey how entrepreneurial graduates are aware of
   the need for universityindustry collaboration and the dependence on
   government policy and funding. The findings generate implications.
   Originality/value: This study contributes to theory and practice as well
   as a framework illustrating the articulation among formulated research
   propositions and underlining their positioning within the mutual
   engagement of Triple Helix dynamics.},

	abstract = {In the digital age, companies transform their overall business models
   but also all their corporate functions - including the management
   control function. Management controllers ensure the dissemination of
   information for managerial decision-making but also advice managers at
   all corporate levels. Against this background, we analyze the tensions
   that arise in the digital age for the work and role of management
   controllers. Based on French field-study evidence, our study highlights
   that when faced with the Big Data phenomenon, management controllers
   need to heavily invest in data-collection and -reliability missions,
   leaving less time for advising managers and challenging operational
   business units. Nevertheless, if management controllers avoid getting
   locked into these more technical tasks and once they master Big Data and
   new tools, they can become actively involved in the digital
   transformation of their companies. Thus, they add value to the emerging
   mass of data by making sense of that data, reflecting on business
   opportunities and challenging operational units and top-management with

	abstract = {Healthcare networks are sophisticated systems, which are commonly
   comprised of medical and drug suppliers, insurance companies,
   third-party logistics (3PL) providers, and regulators. Effective
   healthcare systems should be capable of sustainably delivering high
   quality and accessible patient care services using data shared through
   the best available technologies. However, healthcare data are generally
   hard to comprehend, use, and share since they are also inaccessible,
   non-standardized, and disseminated throughout the network. Blockchain
   may be employed to alleviate the impact of these challenges. However,
   only a few blockchain platforms (BP) have reached the stable design and
   established user base needed to give a healthcare organization (HO)
   confidence in their implementation. Each digital transformation project
   employing blockchain faces the challenge of picking a BP suitable to the
   requirements of a HO. While some research has been conducted to choose
   an appropriate BP, quantitative studies on specific industries,
   including healthcare, are currently insufficient. This investigation
   provides a case addressing the selection of the most feasible BP for a
   healthcare group. To this end, we propose a new multi-criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) framework that integrates the extent
   analysis-based rough Analytic Hierarchy Process (RAHP-E) and rough
   Compromise Programming (RCP). The findings of this study are validated

	abstract = {This study examines the relationship between regional agglomeration and
   the digitalisation of manufacturing small and medium enterprises (SMEs),
   and how this interplay affects their productivity. Using two analytical
   models, we investigate the correlation of regional agglomeration factors
   such as industrial specialisation, related and unrelated variety,
   urbanisation economies and the spatial concentration of suppliers with
   SMEs' digitalisation level in South Korea. Our findings indicate that
   related variety within regional agglomerations positively influences
   digital innovation, facilitating knowledge spillovers particularly
   beneficial for SMEs with higher levels of digitalisation. The study
   reveals a differentiated impact of agglomeration economies on SMEs based
   on their digital maturity. While high-level digitalised enterprises
   benefit from related variety and urbanisation economies, those in the
   initial stages of digital adoption gain proximity to digital technology
   suppliers. The 2SLS models further demonstrate that digitalisation
   significantly enhances productivity across all levels of digital
   technology adoption among SMEs. This study emphasises the conditional
   nature of the effects of regional agglomeration on digitalisation and
   productivity, advocating for nuanced support strategies that cater to
   the varying digital maturity stages of SMEs, which are valuable for
   policymakers and business leaders in fostering a supportive regional
   ecosystem that propels SMEs towards greater productivity in the digital
   economy.},

	abstract = {Featured Application
   The security architecture proposed can be implemented in any application
   that involves the use of autonomous vehicles, both terrestrial and
   aerial, e.g., monitoring of crops and livestock behaviour with UAVs
   (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles); autonomous control of implements in tractors
   to prepare the ground, to sow the seeds, to apply precise amounts of
   fertilizer or to maintain the crops; surveillance of areas with UAVs to
   detect intruders or wild animals; UAV-based sampling systems; etc.
   Nowadays, autonomous vehicles are incorporated into farms to facilitate
   manual labour. Being connected vehicles, as IoT systems, they are
   susceptible to cyber security attacks that try to cause damage to
   hardware, software or even living beings. Therefore, it is important to
   provide sufficient security mechanisms to protect both the
   communications and the data, mitigating any possible risk or harm to
   farmers, livestock or crops. Technology providers are aware of the
   importance of ensuring security, and more and more secure solutions can
   be found on the market today. However, generally, these particular
   solutions are not sufficient when they are part of complex hybrid
   systems, since there is no single global solution proposal. In addition,
   as the number of technologies and protocols used increases, the number
   of security threats also increases. This article presents a
   cyber-security architecture proposal for swarms of heterogeneous
   vehicles in smart farming, which covers all of the aspects recommended
   by the ISO 7798-2 specification in terms of security. As a result of
   this analysis, a detailed summary of the possible solutions and
   available technologies for each of the communication channels of the
   target system as well as some recommendations are presented.},

	abstract = {After the 2007-08 global financial crisis, research flourished on
   entrepreneurship through digital innovation in the financial market as
   well as on investors' influence on digital technology-based
   entrepreneurs' funding decisions. This study combines these two research
   streams to analyze the decision-making criteria for funding financial
   technology companies (fintechs), hybrid companies that combine digital
   entrepreneurship, technology, and banking. The study first uses prior
   literature to derive important characteristics to define fintechs and
   then uses 12 expert interviews to elaborate on decision-making criteria
   in funding. Except for smaller peculiarities, fintech funding does not
   appear to differ from that of other digital entrepreneurship in
   different markets, and-as with most digital business models-scalability
   was identified as a key criterion. Additionally, by serving as a major
   provider of money for young companies, banks have changed their role and
   positioning in funding new financial technology entrepreneurs. Through
   developments in digital technology, banks have shifted from traditional
   money-lending activities (i.e., debt-financing) to becoming stakeholders
   in fintechs and, hence, equity investors. We also describe how these
   formerly distinct fields have converged due to regulatory requirements,
   digital newcomers, and a need for constant innovation, with their future
   sustainable development dependent on sharing and collaboration.},

	abstract = {The influence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and related produced data
   is destined to revolutionize economic and social society, even more
   incisively than the advent of digital. The creation of the IoT world
   would have been much more complicated if a big data structure had not
   been followed since the latter allows to analyze vast amounts of data.
   The IoT is the most significant flow of information collected on the
   Internet and, therefore, the largest supplier for big data systems,
   artificial intelligence (AI), and data science. Advanced statistical
   analysis techniques, neural networks, and AI algorithms, but also the
   ability to create mathematical models that best represent a physical
   phenomenon or social behavior, these are the new strategic assets in the
   digital transformation process that is facing the world of industry and
   services. In fact, collecting data is not enough: they must be managed,
   integrated, and compared with a mathematical model that formalizes the
   intrinsic knowledge in the experience and competence of people.},

	abstract = {Construction is one of the least-digitized industries in the economy. To
   rein in the rising costs of building activities, digital transformation
   is one of the pillars that industry leaders rely on. A case in point are
   logistics processes which are characterized by very limited visibility
   and inefficient organization. To progress beyond this current state of
   the art, we conceptualize the idea of a lightweight digital twin for
   non-high-tech industries. In collaboration with a leading supplier of
   building materials, we explore the opportunities offered by digital silo
   twin capabilities. Focusing on fill level monitoring we identify diverse
   opportunities for generating informational, automational and
   transformational business value. Leveraging new information sources for
   the redesign of core business processes drastically increases the
   complexity of operational decision-making. To tap into these
   opportunities, we design and implement a decision support system for
   silo dispatch and replenishment activity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

   blockchain-based EHR system enhancing the storage of medical records and
   data exchange among healthcare providers and reducing environmental
   uncertainty. The potential benefits of the implementation of our
   distributed network regard clinical outcomes (e.g., improved quality,
   reduced medical errors), organizational outcomes (e.g., financial,
   operational benefits), and managerial outcomes (e.g., improved ability
   to conduct research, improved population health, reduced costs). Future

   enhancement of the demand for e-books by academic libraries promotes the
   process of the digital transformation of academic publishers. This study
   then argues that Chinese academic publishers need to further improve the

@article{WOS:001197568100001,
	abstract = {Background: Stroke is a prevalent disease with a significant global
   impact. Effective assessment of stroke severity is vital for an accurate
   diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and optimal clinical outcomes. The
   National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a widely used
   scale for quantitatively assessing stroke severity. However, the current
   manual scoring of NIHSS is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and
   sometimes unreliable. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
   to automate the quantitative assessment of stroke on vast amounts of
   electronic health records (EHRs) has attracted much interest. Objective:
   This study aims to develop an automatic, quantitative stroke severity
   assessment framework through automating the entire NIHSS scoring process
   on Chinese clinical EHRs. Methods: Our approach consists of two major
   parts: Chinese clinical named entity recognition (CNER) with a domain
   -adaptive pre -trained large language model (LLM) and automated NIHSS
   scoring. To build a highperforming CNER model, we first construct a
   stroke -specific, densely annotated dataset ``Chinese Stroke Clinical
   Records{''}(CSCR) from EHRs provided by our partner hospital, based on a
   stroke ontology that defines semantically related entities for stroke
   assessment. We then pre -train a Chinese clinical LLM coined
   ``CliRoberta{''}through domain -adaptive transfer learning and construct
   a deep learning -based CNER model that can accurately extract entities
   directly from Chinese EHRs. Finally, an automated, end -to -end NIHSS
   scoring pipeline is proposed by mapping the extracted entities to
   relevant NIHSS items and values, to quantitatively assess the stroke
   severity. Results: Results obtained on a benchmark dataset CCKS2019 and
   our newly created CSCR dataset demonstrate the superior performance of
   our domain -adaptive pre -trained LLM and the CNER model, compared with
   the existing benchmark LLMs and CNER models. The high F1 score of 0.990
   ensures the reliability of our model in accurately extracting the
   entities for the subsequent automatic NIHSS scoring. Subsequently, our
   automated, end -to -end NIHSS scoring approach achieved excellent inter
   -rater agreement (0.823) and intraclass consistency (0.986) with the
   ground truth and significantly reduced the processing time from minutes
   to a few seconds. Conclusion: Our proposed automatic and quantitative
   framework for assessing stroke severity demonstrates exceptional
   performance and reliability through directly scoring the NIHSS from
   diagnostic notes in Chinese clinical EHRs. Moreover, this study also
   contributes a new clinical dataset, a pre -trained clinical LLM, and an
   effective deep learning -based CNER model. The deployment of these
   advanced algorithms can improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinical
   assessment, and help improve the quality, affordability and productivity
   of healthcare services.},

	abstract = {Dynamic capabilities that enable innovation are crucial to survival and
   success in today's highly competitive business environment, because they
   enable organizational adaptation, transformation, and seizing of
   opportunities. Absorptive capacity is an important dynamic capability
   that enables organizations to leverage external knowledge for innovation
   purposes. In this theory-building article, we address the fundamental
   research question of how organizations can leverage external partners as
   external sources of knowledge. We offer three primary contributions to
   the literature on managerial decision-making. First, by conceptualizing
   knowledge absorption as a collaborative, interorganizational endeavor,
   we extend the literature on absorptive capacity, thereby enabling its
   application to innovation-related contexts aside from R\&D, to which it
   has traditionally been applied. Second, by focusing on social
   integration mechanisms as links between the capabilities, expertise, and
   knowledge of individuals, groups, and the organization as a whole, we
   heed calls to clarify the microfoundations of organizational
   capabilities. Third, although social integration is a multidimensional
   construct, few studies have addressed the influence of its individual
   dimensions. We outline how individual social integration dimensions
   exert differing influences on the individual knowledge absorption
   stages, thereby taking a first step toward unraveling the
   multidimensional nature of social integration and laying the foundation
   for future social integration research both in and beyond the absorptive
   capacity context.},

	abstract = {Purpose - Digitally oriented firms are faced with new opportunities and
   risks in today's ever-changing world. Drawing upon organisational
   entrainment theory, this study investigates how supply chain (SC)
   entrainment improves the effects of digital orientation on firm
   performance through absorbing risks and exploiting
   opportunities.Design/methodology/approachSurvey data were collected from
   307 Chinese manufactures and analysed using structural equation
   modelling and regression analysis.Findings - The results show digital
   orientation absorbs risk through evoking three SC entrainment dimensions
   (i.e. internal entrainment, entrainment with customers and entrainment
   with suppliers). Entrainment with customers and suppliers mediate the
   relationship between internal entrainment and firm performance. An
   opportunity exploitation mechanism is evidenced by the moderating
   effects of internal and external entrainment on the relationship between
   digital orientation and firm performance.Practical implications - The
   empirical findings provide timely insights for managers to fully harness
   the benefits of digital orientation by using SC entrainment, i.e. to
   match the tempo and pace of internal and external cyclical activities to
   reduce the risks and increase the benefits of adopting advanced digital
   technologies. The authors show managers how to adjust their
   organization's actions to keep tempo and synchronous phase with their SC
   partners.Originality/value - The study introduces and conceptualizes a
   construct (i.e. SC entrainment) to understand how risks and
   opportunities arising from digital transformation can be addressed to
   maximize the value of advanced digital technologies.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis is put forward that, after three decades of stability,
   there is now the prospect of significant change in the vertical and
   horizontal structure of the mobile market place. On the supply side,
   significant factors are, first, the availability of a new and very
   powerful form of mobile connectivity in the shape of 5G, and second,
   software defined networking, which allows a single network to provide a
   variety of heterogeneous services or `slices'. On the demand side, the
   digital transformation of the whole economy (and not just the
   communications sector) creates the need for diverse communications
   functions operating in a universe with a much wider set of digitally
   transformed services.
   Mobile operators will find themselves contesting customer relationship
   with firms or other organisations providing these services in an
   integrated fashion, and thus risk replacing their direct link with end
   users with becoming the wholesale supplier of an expanded but
   `commoditised' communications product. We may also observe fewer radio
   access networks; more competitive backhaul; and the (partial) vertical
   disintegration of mobile network operators. The regulatory changes
   implied may include heavier regulation of fewer RANs, and the need for
   market analyses to confront situations in which network operators sell
   more and more of their services to a variety of heterogeneous content
   and application providers - some of them exercising substantial levels
   of market power.},

	abstract = {In striking contrast to the hot debate on the effect of the Green Credit
   Policy (GCP) on heavy-polluting enterprises (HPEs), little attention has
   been paid to the policy effect on upstream enterprises of HPEs in the
   green supply chain. Using the data of China's A-share listed companies
   from 2009 to 2020 and regarding the promulgation of GCP as a
   quasi-natural experiment, we manually collect upstream suppliers
   providing source control and end-of-pipe treatments to HPEs and
   investigate the impact of GCP on the green innovation in these
   suppliers. Findings show that: (i) The GCP promotes green innovation in
   upstream suppliers of HPEs, especially those providing end-of-pipe
   treatments. Such findings hold after a series of robustness tests. (ii)
   Green innovation in these suppliers increases alternatively after
   promulgating the policy. A higher-than-average growth in green
   innovation in SOEs (state-owned enterprises) supplying advanced
   equipment for source control, non-SOEs providing end-of-pipe treatments,
   large-scale enterprises, as well as suppliers in cities with
   well-developed finance systems, suggesting that these enterprises are
   more likely to collaborate with HPEs under credit constraints. (iii)
   Insight into the potential mechanisms reveals that the credit policy can
   effectively improve internal environmental concerns and demand-induced
   trade credits of upstream suppliers to green the supply chain.},

	abstract = {Over the last 15 years, there has been great interest and commensurate
   momentum in the land administration industry on realising the notion of
   `3D cadastres'. This leverages 3D digital technologies for producing,
   managing, registering and communicating information about complex,
   volumetrically defined land and property rights, restrictions and
   responsibilities (RRRs) that are commonly found in cities and urban
   areas around the world. There has been significant technical progress
   but implementation remains uncertain. This paper draws on research
   conducted on the implementation of 3D Building Information Models (BIM)
   for regulatory processes in the land development industry in Singapore
   to illustrate the range of strategies used to induce change in an
   instance of 3D digital innovation. The adoption of institutional theory
   as an analytical framework provides insight into the cultural and
   behavioural underpinnings of these strategies and what makes them
   particularly effective in producing a positive response to change. Given
   the similarity in the institutional characteristics of the land
   development and land administration industries, the case study findings
   are used to develop a framework of strategic principles that could
   conceivably be used to support ongoing international efforts to realise
   3D cadastres. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Servitisation, which occurs when products are offered with service
   components as product-service bundles, has increased rapidly in consumer
   markets during recent years because of digitalisation. Digital
   technologies have enabled the emergence of peer-to-peer marketplaces and
   made it possible for B2B lease and rental actors to push for B2C
   markets. Despite extensive research on servitisation, we know little of
   what kinds of companies can best exploit the opportunities created by it
   and how digitalisation affects inter-company relationships regarding
   these opportunities. This article addresses these research gaps by
   making a revelatory case study on the entry order and strategy of
   established B2B lease companies to enter the B2C private leasing and
   carsharing markets. We collect an interview-based dataset on key
   companies in the Dutch car lease market, that we analyse abductively. We
   find that knowledge of the opportunities, position in the value chain,
   and resources are focal elements that define which companies are
   pioneers, early followers, and late entrants. In contrast to former
   servitisation literature, manufacturing incumbent companies are not
   active in exploiting opportunities created by private leasing.
   Additionally, we discover that the leasing companies create capabilities
   for private leasing themselves whereas they partner to enable
   carsharing. We discuss the contribution of these findings to research on
   disruptive innovation, servitisation, and digital innovation.},

	abstract = {ObjectiveThis paper aims to report our experience of developing,
   implementing, and evaluating myHealthE (MHE), a digital innovation for
   Child and Adolescents Mental Health Services (CAMHS), which automates
   the remote collection and reporting of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures
   (PROMs) into National Health Services (NHS) electronic healthcare
   records.MethodsWe describe the logistical and governance issues
   encountered in developing the MHE interface with patient-identifiable
   information, and the steps taken to overcome these development barriers.
   We describe the application's architecture and hosting environment to
   enable its operability within the NHS, as well as the capabilities
   needed within the technical team to bridge the gap between academic
   development and NHS operational teams.ResultsWe present evidence on the
   feasibility and acceptability of this system within clinical services
   and the process of iterative development, highlighting additional
   functions that were incorporated to increase system
   utility.ConclusionThis article provides a framework with which to plan,
   develop, and implement automated PROM collection from remote devices
   back to NHS infrastructure. The challenges and solutions described in
   this paper will be pertinent to other digital health innovation
   researchers aspiring to deploy interoperable systems within NHS clinical
   systems.},

	abstract = {Digital intelligent supply chains strengthen industrial resilience and
   optimize economic efficiency in the timber industry. Information
   asymmetry and low collaboration efficiency remain key challenges across
   the timber supply chain. This study develops a three-party evolutionary
   game model examining digital collaboration between timber production and
   processing enterprises, finished product distribution and retail
   enterprises, and third-party service providers, introducing third-party
   service providers alongside traditional production and distribution
   enterprises. The model incorporates novel parameters including
   information sharing degree, value-added reliability gains, and
   free-riding coefficients to reflect real-world circumstances. Through
   equilibrium simulation and analysis, we identify four possible
   evolutionary states. The results demonstrate that successful digital
   collaboration in timber supply chains relies on three conditions: a high
   level of initial stakeholder involvement accelerates the formation of
   supply chain digital intelligent collaborative mechanisms, equitable
   benefit distribution maintains long-term cooperation, and integrated
   third-party services reduce implementation costs while improving
   information reliability. These findings provide a new perspective and
   reference for timber enterprises to implement digital transformation

   ideas has become reality in many organizations - often exceeding the
   available resources to execute them. Building on insights from a
   literature review and a 3-year collaboration with a banking software

   address this challenge. Following a design science research approach, it
   suggests a prescriptive design theory that provides
   practitioner-oriented guidance for implementing a DISC. The study shows
   that, in order to facilitate the assessment, selection, and tracking of
   ideas for different stakeholders, such a system needs to play a dual
   role: It needs to structure decision criteria and at the same be
   flexible to allow for creative expression. Moreover, the paper makes a
   case for scenario-based design theorizing by developing design knowledge

	abstract = {The use of mobile phone apps for digital transactions has increased by
   leaps and bounds due to the proliferation of smart phones at affordable
   prices and rapidly growing ease of access to quality internet services.
   This study uses the technology acceptance model and unified theory of
   acceptance and use of technology as lenses to explore: 1) the impact of
   mobile apps' security features, integrity (trust \& privacy),
   transparency and utilities (facilities \& usefulness) on the behavioral
   intention to use mobile apps and 2) the mediating influence of social
   influence on the relationship between the aforementioned variables. The
   results of exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regression
   highlight significant positive relationships between security, integrity
   and utilities, and the intention to use mobile payment apps for digital
   transactions. Social influence partially mediates the relationship
   between security and users' intention but completely mediates the
   relationship in the case of integrity and utilities. Thus, in the era of
   digital transformation, service providers should focus on improving
   security and integrity features along with making payment apps more

   from collaborations with the most productive partner countries.
   Singaporean scholars were found to have a significant impact on the
   community, with their articles accounting for nearly 49\% of the total
   citations. SEA scholars tended to focus on a few research topics such as
   applications of e-learning, online learning, and blended learning,
   digital education and digital transformation during the COVID-19

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Digitalisation impacts value creation and capture in all
   industries economic sectors. One of the somewhat less researched and
   less well-understood contexts is agriculture.OBJECTIVE: To describe the
   impacts of digitalisation on value creation through four dimensions of
   the value chain - activities, flows, actors and governance - and analyse
   the implications of these changes for value capture.METHODS: We
   conducted a case study on the upstream section of a farm's value chain,
   including the most relevant actors, and complemented it with secondary
   data from papers and gray literature.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found
   two important impacts: (i) value creation occurs increasingly through
   platforms operated by big players beyond the industry boundaries, and
   (ii) value capture by farmers depends on the competitive dynamics among
   these players, and on policies and regulations.SIGNIFICANCE: The study
   addresses the four dimensions of the agricultural value chain, allowing
   a deeper understanding of its digital transformation. The paper also
   contributes to knowledge about the evolution of the industries involved
   by discussing the competitive dynamics. These views are relevant to
   guiding the strategic decisions of suppliers, farmers and policymakers.},

	abstract = {The increasing interconnectedness of the world, coupled with the
   proliferation of connected devices, networks, and intricate systems, has
   paved the way for unparalleled opportunities in automation and
   sophisticated digital transformation. This has also led to a global rise
   in the adoption of smart and intelligent technologies within the smart
   home market. Norway, being a technologically advanced country with
   digitally skilled citizens, presents a potential market for the
   widespread adoption of smart home technologies. However, there is a lack
   of research on the adoption of smart home technology (SHT), specifically
   in Norway. Hence, this study aims at investigating the factors that
   influence Norwegian consumers' intentions to adopt smart home
   technologies, as well as the diffusion of smart home adoption in the
   Norwegian market. Employing a mixed-methods research design, this study
   gathered insights from both consumers and vendors through ten
   qualitative interviews and a survey with 100 participants over the
   period of seven months. The findings of this study provide empirical
   evidence supporting the significance of hedonic motivation, perceived
   price value, and social influence in relation to the use and adoption of
   SHT.},

	abstract = {With current developments in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI)
   comes an increased focus on the ethical production and use of such novel
   technologies. Accordingly, a trend toward ``embedded ethics{''}is seen
   in recent research, reflecting an increase in efforts to integrate
   social and ethical considerations in computer science education and
   early in the development phases of AI and robotics. What remains to be
   established, however, is a more concrete understanding of the best
   working modalities for such interdisciplinary collaborations. In this
   brief discussion paper, we provide reflections derived from our
   interdisciplinary Responsible Robotics project which integrates
   ethicists and social scientists at early stages of development. We put
   forward several suggestions on how to integrate ethics and social
   science within technological development. We believe these suggestions
   can serve as a working taxonomy of best practices for embedded ethics.\&

	abstract = {In recent years, mobile health applications (mHealth apps) have created
   a new social context in the clinical diagnosis process based on
   technology innovation. To improve understanding of digital
   transformation in healthcare and determinants for its implementation,
   this article examines the available mHealth apps addressed to medical
   practitioners and explores these apps features' trustworthiness,
   quality, and popularity. Based on the normalization process theory, we
   explain the process from the introduction of mHealth innovation in the
   clinical practice to the intention of professional engagement. We
   conduct content analysis of the apps' descriptions, functions, and user
   reviews; measured available app features and performance metrics; and
   applied statistical analysis to understand features intercorrelations
   and users' preferences. We observe moderate levels of reliability and
   quality in the existing mHealth apps, revealing margins for potential
   improvement. The mHealth app star rating, quality score, and downloads
   are all highly intercorrelated. The apps with more features score higher
   in quality, especially those with credible sources, feedback
   opportunities, and ``how to use{''} instructions. App development from
   credible sources can increase their trustworthiness. Further,
   technological advances in these apps can greatly benefit health
   professionals' everyday practice and, thus, healthcare for society. This
   article contributes to the information systems research by using social
   theories to reveal the importance of app features to the adoption of
   professional health applications and underline the sets of
   policies/practices that should apply in the app development process to
   strengthen clinical efficiency and effectiveness.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the increasingly complex macroeconomic environment has
   posed new challenges to the sustainable development of enterprises and
   the prevention of supply chain risks. This article examines Chinese
   A-shares listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2021 as
   a research sample, utilizing a multi-period double difference model to
   investigate the impact of cross-border e-commerce reform on enterprise
   supply chain risk. The findings suggest that cross-border e-commerce
   reform significantly mitigates supply chain risks for enterprises.
   Further heterogeneity testing revealed that the establishment of
   cross-border e-commerce pilot zones primarily reduces supply chain risks
   for non-state-owned enterprises located in coastal areas and those with
   digital infrastructure. The mechanism test demonstrates that
   cross-border e-commerce reform lowers the supply chain risk level of
   enterprises by enhancing their degree of digital transformation and
   easing their financing constraints. Additionally, the economic
   consequence test shows that cross-border e-commerce reform improves
   investment efficiency and reduces the risk of stock price collapse by
   alleviating supply chain risks. The research conclusions drawn offer
   important insights on how to leverage cross-border e-commerce

	abstract = {Even with the availability of modelling languages such as 4EM and
   ArchiMate, a noticeable uncertainty persists among professionals
   regarding the efficient development of process models in the software
   ecosystem. While current enterprise modelling frameworks and guidelines
   provide valuable perspectives on essential quality aspects, they are
   usually more abstract to apply in real-world scenarios directly. This
   study compares the features of 4EM and ArchiMate, underlining their
   distinct characteristics for a specific context of software outsourcing.
   Further, this paper demonstrates a choice of appropriate views of these
   two modelling languages to model a decision-making scenario for software
   vendor analysis and selection. Thus, this research supports software
   enterprises to understand their business processes related explicitly to
   outsourcing and benefits company personnel involved in decision-making.
   In addition to model development, 4EM and ArchiMate are tested for the
   extent they fit for modelling the given decision-making context in the
   software ecosystem. It is observed that ArchiMate is better suited to
   the given context. Afterwards, the models are validated using the SEQUAL
   framework which resulted in identification and incorporation of a new
   process activity in `As-Is' scenario. This further provided means for
   digital innovation for `To-Be' scenario of enterprise business process.
   However, the models developed in this study are premature since they are
   validated with a theoretical framework only, and the involvement of
   experts is limited. Thus, more validation studies are required in actual
   settings with more experts to improve the models further.},

	abstract = {Seaports are genuine, intermodal hubs connecting seaways to inland
   transport links, such as roads and railways. Seaports are located at the
   focal point of institutional, industrial, and control activities in a
   jungle of interconnected information systems. System integration is
   setting considerable challenges when a group of independent providers
   are asked to implement complementary software functionalities. For this
   reason, seaports are the ideal playground where software is highly
   composite and tailored to a large variety of final users (from the
   so-called port communities). Although the target would be that of
   shaping the Port Authorities to be providers of (digital) innovation
   services, the state-of-the-art is still that of considering them as
   final users, or proxies of them. For this reason, we show how a
   canonical cloud, virtualizing a distributed architecture, can be
   structured to host different, possibly overlapped, tenants, slicing the
   information system at the infrastructure, platform, and software layers.
   Resources at the infrastructure and platform layers are shared so that a
   variety of independent applications can make use of the local calculus
   and access the data stored in a Data Lake. Such a cloud is adopted by
   the Port of Livorno as a rapid prototyping framework for the development
   and deployment of ICT innovation services. In order to demonstrate the
   versatility of this framework, three case studies relating to as many
   prototype ICT services (Navigation Safety, e-Freight, and Logistics)
   released within three industrial tenants are here presented and

	abstract = {A firm's use of boundary-spanning information systems (BSIS) can be
   beneficial for innovation by providing access to market-facing
   information. At the same time, BSIS use can give rise to information
   overload, making it difficult for firms to leverage the most pertinent
   information for innovation. Although there has been progress in
   developing the understanding of the role of IS in innovation, it is
   unclear what capabilities firms need to develop to facilitate innovation
   in the presence of information overload from BSIS (IO-BSIS). We maintain
   that firms are increasingly experiencing IO-BSIS and therefore a
   thorough investigation of firm-level capabilities to facilitate
   innovation while coping with IO-BSIS is needed. To address this
   important gap, we broaden the theory of problemistic search for
   innovation by proposing a digitally enabled collaborative problemistic
   search (CPS) capability. We propose that a cross-stream CPS effect-the
   interaction of CPS with customers (CPS-C) and CPS with suppliers
   (CPS-S)-can enable firms to reinvigorate their internal knowledge for
   innovation by engaging customers and suppliers in filtering and
   interpreting market-facing information. Further, we theorize that the
   presence or absence of IO-BSIS is a contingency factor that affects
   whether the cross-stream CPS effect is likely to be beneficial or
   detrimental to innovation. Based on the analysis of data collected from
   227 firms, we find that the cross-stream CPS effect is beneficial for
   innovation when firms face IO-BSIS and detrimental to innovation when
   firms do not experience IO-BSIS. We thus open the black box of the
   digitally enabled innovation activity by shedding light on specific

	abstract = {Society and policy demand greater sustainability of food systems,
   driving practitioners to improve the transparency of supply chain
   networks through digital innovation. Uncertainties regarding the
   structuring of relationships with primary and secondary stakeholders for
   sharing intangible data and information diminishes the potential for
   exploitation of digital transparency. While businesses are accustomed to
   organizing efficient flows of tangible goods, management research
   integrating digital transparency considerations to investigate and
   conceptualize structural changes in agri-food supply chain networks
   (AFSCNs) is scarce. This gap motivates the following four questions of
   this study: (1) Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders in the
   AFSCNs of the digital era? (2) What are their transparency interests?
   (3) How do AFSCN structures change with the emergence of digital
   innovations that can facilitate sustainability transition through
   greater transparency? (4) How to conceptualize those structural changes
   to AFSCNs? The netchain approach and respective transparency concept are
   integrated with classical stakeholder theory. Data was collected via a
   series of 21 semi-structured pilot interviews with technology providers
   in the EU agri-food sector and analyzed using structured content
   analysis. Results paint a complex picture of contemporary primary and
   secondary stakeholders of AFSCNs and their interests. Primary
   stakeholder interests lead to coopetition in vertical and horizontal
   relationships of the netchain and low transparency efforts by
   intermediaries. Both hamper the dissemination of digital innovations and
   the exploitation of their potential to improve AFSCN sustainability.
   Among secondary stakeholders, policymakers and governments, NGOs, and
   technology providers excel in being drivers of digital transparency for
   sustainability, with social media as a strong direct communication tool
   to reach netchain stakeholders, consumers, and research
   institutes/universities as collaborators and customers. The emergence of
   ``information AFSCN{''} and ``digital AFSCN{''} increases the complexity
   of the whole supply chain network through intermediation,
   reconfiguration, and emergence modes of change to underlying structures.
   Agri-food business managers, scientists, and policymakers should
   innovate in private and public governance to facilitate collaborative
   advantage and sustainability in a combination aligned with innovative
   digital transparency solutions.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is about realizing digital transformation by linking
   machines to plants, fleets, and humans through sensors and control
   elements in order to create smart networks, smart factories, smart
   manufacturing, and smart value chains. By leveraging I4.0 technologies,
   a small and medium enterprise (SME) can increase its organizational
   agility, adaptability, and resilience to cope with today's competitive
   environment by becoming a valuable and innovative partner in the power
   dynamics with its large buyer counterparts. However, SMEs face
   technology, trust, and big data challenges when they adopt I4.0
   technologies. This study provides new solutions for SMEs to overcome
   these three challenges in implementing I4.0. Specifically, the paper
   proposes the following: (1) a roadmap for the application of I4.0
   technologies to enhance the collaboration capabilities of SMEs; (2) a
   structure for I4.0 standardization to develop and sustain trust among
   partners; and (3) an improved data science platform for systematizing
   big data to extract critical information for collaboration solutions for
   SMEs. Addi-tionally, the solutions are evaluated based on an application
   case of a Greek SME, demonstrating their potentials for practical
   implementation.},

	abstract = {PurposeThis study investigates how to motivate behavioral intentions
   toward green investment (BIGI) with the moderating effect of social
   media platforms usage (SMPU) among individual investors in
   Egypt.Design/methodology/approachThe study used partial least squares
   structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data and test
   hypotheses based on a sample of 550 individual investors with investment
   experience.FindingsThe results show that attitude, subjective norm (SN),
   and perceived behavioral control (PBC) have a significant relationship
   with investors' behavioral intention toward green investment. The
   moderating effect of (SMPU) supported the relationship between (SN),
   (PBC), and (BIGI), but (SMPU) does not support the relationship between
   attitude and (BIGI).Practical implicationsThis study provides some
   implications for investment providers, service providers, and
   policymakers.Originality/valueDespite the increasing global interest in
   climate change and its consequent opportunities and challenges for
   business, previous studies did not strongly emphasize green investment.
   So, based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study sheds
   light on the motivational factors that may push investors' behavioral
   intentions toward green investment. With the increasing interest in
   digital transformation, the study also examined how digital platforms
   support (BIGI), especially in Egypt as a developing country.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, advances in digital technologies have begun
   to transform three aspects of mental health care. The use of sensors and
   artificial intelligence (AI) have provided new, objective measures of
   how we think, feel, and behave. The ease of connecting and communicating
   remotely has transformed the brick-and-mortar practice of mental health
   care into a telehealth service, increasing access and convenience for
   both patients and providers. And the advent of digital therapeutics,
   from virtual reality for treating phobias to conversational agents for
   delivering structured therapies, promises to alter how treatments will
   be delivered in the future. These digital transformations can help to
   solve many of the key challenges facing mental health care, including
   access, quality, and accountability. But digital technology introduces a
   new set of challenges around trust, privacy, and equity. Despite high
   levels of investment and promotion, there remain profound questions
   about efficacy and safety of digital mental health technologies. We
   share our experiences from the front lines creating digital innovations
   for mental health, with a focus on what a digital transformation of care

	abstract = {In the digital transformation era, the Internet is rapidly evolving, as
   represented by the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence.
   Accordingly, information security incidents are increasing and
   diversifying. An example of this diversification is the emergence of
   internal fraud in telework and other scenarios. As a countermeasure, the
   software-defined perimeter (SDP), a zero-trust model, is attracting
   attention. SDP ensures that users are always secure by authenticating
   and authorizing them each time a service is provided. SDP is expected to
   be integrated with the IoT in order to expand its application. However,
   it is difficult to ensure the security of the IoT itself due to the lack
   of resources, such as CPU power and storage. Therefore, when embedding
   IoT devices into SDP, the main issue is how to ensure the reliability of
   the IoT itself, but this has not been sufficiently studied. In this
   article, we propose a method to compensate for the lack of IoT resources
   so that it can be securely embedded into SDP. We investigated several
   federation methods and found through qualitative evaluation that the
   identity provider is the most effective and can efficiently achieve
   authentication and authorization in SDP.},

	abstract = {Current approaches to managing digital identities struggle to meet the
   demands of ongoing digital transformation. They either create fragmented
   identities tied to specific online services, making it difficult for
   users to manage, or they raise concerns about being locked into
   corporate identity providers and data protection issues. Additionally,
   they provide limited support for machine-verifiable identity attributes.
   This reliance on third parties for managing machine identities can put
   companies at a market disadvantage. Therefore, there is a pressing need
   for a unified identity management solution that allows for the portable
   and interoperable use of verifiable identity data across services. The
   recently announced European Digital Identity Wallet marks a significant
   step forward in digital identity management. This initiative aims to
   provide EU citizens with a unified, secure, and convenient way to access
   both public and private online services, thereby enhancing the
   efficiency and security of digital interactions and prioritizing user
   needs. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) forms the basis for such a
   wallet-based identity ecosystem that supports electronic market growth.
   However, as a relatively new concept, SSI still lacks a unified
   theoretical analysis and a thorough exploration of its value

	abstract = {Challenges of health systems in Latin America and the Caribbean include
   accessibility, inequity, segmentation, and poverty. These challenges are
   similar in different countries of the region and transcend national
   borders. The increasing digital transformation of health care holds
   promise of more precise interventions, improved health outcomes,
   increased efficiency, and ultimately reduced health-care costs. In Latin
   America and the Caribbean, the adoption of digital health tools is in
   early stages and the quality of cancer registries, electronic health
   records, and structured databases are problematic. Cancer research and
   innovation in the region are limited due to inadequate academic
   resources and translational research is almost fully dependent on public
   funding. Regulatory complexity and extended timelines jeopardise the
   potential improvement in participation in international studies.
   Emerging technologies, artificial intelligence, big data, and cancer
   research represent an opportunity to address the health-care challenges
   in Latin America and the Caribbean collectively, by optimising national
   capacities, sharing and comparing best practices, and transferring
   scientific and technical capabilities.},

   effective ways to create value. Based on the three-level rental platform
   service supply chain network structure composed of manufacturers, rental

   equilibrium model considering the digital detection technology input and
   big data marketing is constructed by using variational inequality and

   with the Euler algorithm design procedure and numerical examples, the
   influences of the digital detection technology level, big data marketing
   cost coefficient and cost sharing ratio on the equilibrium state are
   analyzed. The results show that the input of digital detection
   technology leads to the increase in profits of each participant in the
   rental platform service supply chain network and promotes a more
   coordinated development of the supply chain. When the rental platforms
   implement big data marketing, the manufacturers share the cost, which
   can continuously improve the profits of both partners and make the

	abstract = {Digital transformation affects all stages of the agri-food value chain.
   Digitalisation is being combined with innovations and eco-innovations to
   gain a competitive advantage and ensure greater sustained
   competitiveness. However, not all technologies have been implemented in
   the same way and at the same pace by the different companies in the
   agri-food sector. The aim of this research is to identify the internal
   and external drivers of digitalisation in agri-food companies and to
   develop a synthetic index to rank companies based on those drivers,
   before examining the relationship between the position in the ranking
   and innovation. The results reveal that the decisive drivers are
   management support and competitive pressure rather than external support
   from government policies or suppliers. Higher ranking companies in terms
   of the digitalisation process are more proactive in introducing product
   and radical innovations and are the most eco-innovative and thus
   sustainability-oriented. Finally, results show that the digitalisation
   of the sector is marked by the depth of technology implementation,
   specifically IoT, big data and artificial intelligence. Blockchain

	abstract = {This paper investigates whether advanced manufacturing technologies
   (AMT) can modify the patterns of upgrading in manufacturing subsidiaries
   operating in FDI hosting factory economies. Does the digital
   transformation of local manufacturing engender the accumulation of local
   technological and R\&D capabilities, or the beneficial impact of AMT
   remains confined to production capability?
   Analysis is based on primary data collected through in-depth interviews
   with a sample of high-flying manufacturing subsidiaries in Hungary,
   complemented with interviews with AMT providers.
   We find that AMT have spectacularly improved all components of
   production capability. AMT redefined the boundaries of production
   activities and incited a fusion of selected technological activities in
   production activities. AMT deployment has automated selected tacit
   knowledge-intensive technological activities, making the related
   subsidiary-level capabilities obsolete. Conversely, other local
   technological activities have become more knowledge-intensive than
   before.
   AMT propelled the upgrading of subsidiary-level R\&D capabilities by
   supporting specific R\&D activities and by acting as enabler of
   innovation collaboration. AMT created an integrated development
   environment and thus reduced the risks related to the decentralisation
   of R\&D. Altogether, AMT adoption contributed to subsidiary R\&D
   capability becoming `revealed' and further upgraded through learning by
   doing.},

	abstract = {This article examines the evolving landscape of digital geopolitics,
   with a focus on the intensifying technological rivalry between the
   United States and China. It discusses how digital transformation is
   reshaping global power structures, influenced by and contributing to the
   bifurcation of the world through strategic initiatives and differing
   digital ecosystems. The article distinguishes digital geopolitics from
   conventional geopolitics and techno-nationalism on several fronts: the
   shift from hard power centred on territorial control to digital
   dominance; the transcendence of geographical boundaries that have
   conventionally defined geopolitical conflicts; the evolution from
   traditional political alliances to strategic technological partnerships;
   and the competition over setting international standards. Additionally,
   it addresses how corporate power plays a pivotal role in this new era,
   contributing to the shaping of the digital geopolitical landscape.
   Through case studies of Huawei and TikTok, this article demonstrates the
   influence of digital geopolitics on international business (and vice
   versa) as well as the intensified bifurcation of the digital ecosystems.
   The article concludes by arguing that digital geopolitics serves as both
   the by-product of and contributor to the volatile, uncertain, complex

   AMRs.Design/methodology/approachDrawing on innovation of assimilation
   theory (IAT), this study followed an explorative approach using the
   principles of the case study method in business research. The cases
   comprised of four AMR end users and six AMR service providers. Data were
   collected through semi-structured interviews.FindingsFour clusters of
   moderators that affect each stage of AMR assimilation were identified.
   These clusters include organizational attributes of end users (i.e.
   production warehouses), service attributes of service providers,
   technology attributes of AMRs and relational attributes between the AMR
   service providers and the AMR end users.Originality/valueThe authors
   extend the IAT framework by identifying various moderating factors
   between different stages of the AMR assimilation process. To the
   authors' knowledge, this is the first study to introduce the perspective
   of AMR end users in conjunction with AMR service providers to the

   then, should we teach Australian foreign policy and in doing so grow the
   conjunctive tissue of student self-learning in order to prepare students
   for the world of diplomacy necessitated by Australia's international
   workspace? Here, experiential learning can have a powerful effect in the
   teaching of Australian foreign policy and in the development of
   students' life and professional skills. Both in-person simulations

   international mobility study tours can contribute to an effective mix of
   learning experiences and assist us in moving closer toward effective
   practice in the current uncertainties and an era of digital

	abstract = {The ongoing digital revolution is transforming economic production
   systems as well as our daily lives. If the expectancies in terms of
   innovation and opportunities are very high on the supply side, little is
   known about the effective uses of digital tools by customers and the
   impact on them and their consumption patterns, especially in a situation
   of mobility. Tourism for example has been tremendously impacted by the
   digital transformation. It has changed the way people plan, book and
   travel, but also the way the stakeholders communicate on their
   destination. But it is also expected that mobile and wireless
   technologies change the tourist experience of the destination. Mobile
   devices could induce change in tourist behaviour at the last minute in
   situ. By using an analysis in terms of services, we suggest that
   suppliers and tourists in territories coproduce M-tourism services.
   These services depend on the tourist behaviour but also on the supply,
   which is available in the destination. Drawing on a survey conducted on
   the Champs Elysees in Paris in 2018, this paper analyses how different
   types of people (tourists, residents, workers, etc.) are using these
   digital services.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the key factors that enables,
   drives and accelerates the digital transformation all over the world.
   The vision of the IoT is not only the immediate access to the data but
   also the ability to turning data into intelligence. As such, there is a
   growing number of public cloud computing providers offering IoT related
   services, including data processing, data analyzing and data
   visualization. However, with tens of billions of microcontroller-powered
   devices getting involved in the era of IoT, the concerns for overall
   security, privacy and cost are rising constantly and exponentially.
   Furthermore, these issues cannot be solved by public cloud computing
   providers since they mainly focus on the software and services rather
   than on the end devices. In this article, an integrated solution
   including Azure Sphere devices and Azure cloud services is proposed to
   provide a comprehensive and efficient way to ensure security that starts
   in the device and extends to the cloud with limited budgets. Moreover,
   the implementation details including hardware components, software
   design and Azure cloud integration are presented to demonstrate the
   feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, the adoption of new digital technologies in
   healthcare has surged, significantly enhancing care delivery and
   accessibility. However, this digital transformation has been accompanied
   by a sharp increase in cyber-attacks, posing severe risks to hospital
   functionality and patient safety. To address the challenge of planning
   for uncertain future cyber incidents, we propose a two-stage stochastic
   model designed to bolster the cyber resilience of healthcare providers
   by selecting optimal countermeasures in preparation for upcoming cyber
   incidents. Numerical tests demonstrate the model's effectiveness, with
   the Value of the Stochastic Solution showing a 21\% improvement over a
   deterministic approach. To be optimally equipped even for
   low-probability high-impact attacks we incorporate the risk measure
   Conditional Value-at-Risk. The corresponding countermeasure solution led
   to 44\% fewer rejected patients in a worst-case scenario. The robustness
   of the proposed solution is underscored by its consistent performance
   across various scenarios, budget levels, and risk preferences, making it
   a reliable tool for enhancing cybersecurity in healthcare. These results
   highlight the importance of tailored, robust cybersecurity strategies in
   healthcare, ensuring preparedness for a wide range of potential threats.},

	abstract = {The emergence of Industry 4.0, also referred to as the fourth industrial
   revolution, has entirely transformed how the industry or business
   functions and evolves. It can be attributed to its broadening focus on
   automation, decentralization, system integration, cyber-physical
   systems, etc. Its implementation promises numerous benefits in terms of
   higher productivity, greater volatility, better control and streamlining
   of processes, accelerated enterprise growth, sustainable development,
   etc. Despite the worldwide recognition and realization of Industry 4.0,
   its holistic adoption is constrained by the requirements of specific
   skills among the workforce. The personnel are expected to acquire
   adaptive thinking, cognitive and computational skills, predominantly in
   the area of information technology, data analytics, etc. Thus, the
   universities that laid the foundation for future talents or trends in
   society have to adapt and modernize the existing programs, facilities,
   and infrastructure. This reshaping of higher education in consonance
   with the vision of Industry 4.0 possesses its opportunities and
   challenges. There are, of course, a multitude of factors involved and
   they need a reasonable assessment to strategically plan this
   metamorphosis. Therefore, this work aims to explore and analyze the
   different factors that influence the progression and enactment of
   Industry 4.0 in universities for sustainable education. For this
   purpose, a systematic approach based on a questionnaire as well as a
   SWOT (strengths (S), weaknesses (W), opportunities (O), and threats (T))
   integrated with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is adopted. The
   questionnaires are administered to university employees and students (or
   stakeholders) to assess their viewpoint, as well as to estimate the
   priority values for individual factors to be included in SWOT. The AHP
   is implemented to quantify the different factors in terms of weights
   using a pairwise comparison matrix. Finally, the SWOT matrix is
   established depending on the questionnaire assessment and the AHP
   weights to figure out stakeholders' perspectives, in addition to the
   needed strategic scheme. The SWOT implementation of this research
   proposes an aggressive approach for universities, where they must make
   full use of their strengths to take advantage of the emerging
   opportunities in Industry 4.0. The results also indicate that there are
   fundamental requirements for universities in Industry 4.0, including
   effective financial planning, skilled staff, increased industrial
   partnerships, advanced infrastructure, revised curricula, and insightful
   workshops. This investigation undoubtedly underlines the importance of
   practical expertise and the implementation of digital technologies at
   the university level to empower novices with the requisite skills and a
   competitive advantage for Industry 4.0.},

	abstract = {In digital transformation and development, supply chain integration has
   become a key strategy to improve supply chain synergy efficiency and
   enhance enterprise competitiveness. Based on the survey data of 185
   manufacturing enterprises in Tianjin, the fuzzy set qualitative
   comparative analysis (fs QCA) method is used to explore the synergistic
   mechanism of government policy, supply chain partnership, information
   sharing, risk avoidance, and intelligence degree on supply chain
   integration and the interaction among them. The results show that: (1) a
   single factor does not constitute a necessary condition for promoting
   supply chain integration, but the formation and development of supply
   chain partnership plays a universal role in promoting supply chain
   integration; (2) the ``multiple concurrent `` of five factors constitute
   the diversified configuration of a driving supply chain integration
   path, that is, the driving supply chain integration path has the
   characteristic of ``all roads lead to the same destination ``; (3) there
   is a ``sharing `` type, a ``cooperative `` type, and a
   ``cooperative-sharing `` type three equivalent path, whereby the
   formation of supply chain partnership can enhance the trust between
   manufacturing enterprises and suppliers and customers, increase the
   transaction frequency of upstream and downstream enterprises, and
   improve the cooperation efficiency. The utility model can effectively
   reduce the ``long whip `` problem caused by the information asymmetry,
   and improve the operational efficiency and stability of the whole supply
   chain. The purpose of this study is to inspire manufacturing enterprises
   in the context of digital supply chain integration to improve the

	abstract = {Logistics is a sophisticated system involving third-party logistics
   (3PL) providers, freight forwarders, warehousing companies, and
   transport service producers in various transport modes, such as road,
   rail, air, maritime, and multimodal transportation. Furthermore, it is
   possible to add customs clearance agencies, insurance companies, banks,
   and relevant institutions and organizations to the system. Effective
   logistics systems must sustainably provide customers with quality and
   satisfactory logistics services using data shared over advanced
   technologies. Nevertheless, data and information on logistics are
   usually challenging to collect, process, and understand, as they are
   primarily unstructured, unreachable, and unstandardized. Blockchain is a
   new and advanced technology promising to eliminate or mitigate the
   adverse effects of these difficulties. However, blockchain technology
   practices in the logistics industry are extraordinarily scarce; and a
   few blockchain platforms have attempted to produce solutions for a few
   large-scale and global logistics firms. Hence, the digital
   transformation process involving blockchain technology for a logistics
   company encounters the challenge of selecting an appropriate blockchain
   platform for the logistics industry's needs. Although studies have been
   carried out in the relevant literature to select a suitable blockchain
   platform for various industries, few of these studies dealt with
   selecting the best blockchain platform for the logistics industry.
   Hence, experimental studies on choosing the proper blockchain platform
   in the logistics industry that tries to manage outstandingly complicated
   relations and linkages among stakeholders are currently inadequate. The
   current study presents a novel, robust, practical, and powerful
   decision-making tool that can also overcome highly complex uncertainties
   to identify the most feasible blockchain technology for the logistics
   industry. The robustness of the study's findings is validated with
   comprehensive sensitivity and comparative analyses.},

	abstract = {How does the Indian movie industry recoup, rebuild and rejuvenate
   post-COVID-19? Are there new pathways opening up? Is digitization one of
   them? These are the hot topics that are being discussed by practitioners
   in the Indian movie industry, since the global pandemic, COVID-19,
   reduced India as a nation from a thriving movie industry to a struggling
   movie industry. They are illustrative of entrepreneurial failure in the
   Indian movie industry, exposed by COVID-19. There is an urgent need to
   develop alternate pathways for revenue generation to protect the Indian
   movie industry from further decline. With close to 2000 movies being
   released each year, the movie industry was one of the largest
   employment-generating industries in India, bringing both income and joy
   to people's lives in a nation beset by vast differences in wealth.
   However, it has been based on theatrical exhibition rather than
   digitization, with a lukewarm response to digital providers, to its
   detriment. During the pandemic, lack of digital innovation flipped from
   `might do' to `must do' in order to ensure the many family businesses in
   the Indian movie industry survive and monetize developed content. Though
   India's poor lost out on their share of entertainment due to screen
   closures, digitization ensured that the growing middle class could be
   catered to. However, the business model is rapidly changing and the role
   of the producer as an entrepreneur is diminishing because artists and
   technicians are directly striking deals and developing content with
   funding from digital providers.},

	abstract = {By 2000 the European Union (EU) had recognized that its innovation
   capacity was underperforming in comparison to similar competitors and
   trading partners. Although the EU has made an effort to stimulate public
   research and development (R\&D) through policy tools like Pre-Commercial
   Procurement (PCP) and Public Procurement of Innovation (PPI), starting
   with the 2000 Lisbon strategy and continuing through the 2021 updated
   Guidance on Innovation Procurement, there has remained a gap in
   knowledge of and use of these tools, in particular within healthcare.
   The past decades have seen an explosion in the number and use of digital
   technologies across the entire spectrum of healthcare. Demand-driven
   R\&D has lagged here, while new digital health R\&D has largely been
   driven by the supply side in a linear fashion, which can have
   disappointing results. PCP and PPI could have big impacts on the
   development and uptake of innovative health technology. The Platform for
   Innovation of Procurement and Procurement of Innovation (PiPPi) project
   was a Horizon 2020-funded project that ran from December 2018 to May
   2022 with a consortium including seven of Europe's premier research
   hospitals and the Catalan Agency for Health Information. To promote PCP
   and PPI, PiPPi established a virtual Community of Practice (CoP) that
   brings together all stakeholder groups to share and innovate around
   unmet healthcare needs. This perspective presents a brief history of PCP
   and PPI in Europe with a focus on digital innovation in healthcare

	abstract = {In the digital age, software has enabled innovators like Uber and Testa
   to gather crucial data about customers and create revolutionary
   offerings to serve them. Meanwhile, many well-resourced incumbents
   struggle to develop extended digital relationships with customers.
   That's partly because it's hard for companies to change their
   established business models. But the authors point out another inhibitor
   there are repercussions up and down the value chain.
   The authors explain that successful upstarts do not just capture and use
   new data effectively; they also break from traditional reliance on
   outside partners for sourcing inputs and distributing and servicing
   products. They keep more functions in-house a necessary part of
   launching an innovation. But if incumbents do likewise in their own
   efforts to take advantage of digital technology, they risk upsetting
   longtime relationships with suppliers, distributors, and other
   collaborators.
   To navigate this new world, the authors advise managers in traditional
   companies to think about the macro trends that will shape their industry
   in the future, agree on a digital strategy to address customers' needs
   in the long term, and develop better metrics to monitor progress.

	abstract = {This article presents a new paradigm of safeguarding methods through
   digital platforms and technology. Since 2010, a group of researchers in
   Korea have been developing a new experimental methodology of
   inventorying intangible cultural heritage (ICH) utilising a new concept
   of collective intelligence and advanced information technologies. The
   research team established Ichpedia, a web-based ICH encyclopedia and
   archive. The purpose of Ichpedia is four fold. First, it functions as
   the most efficient digital ICH inventorying system available using
   modern information technologies. It is possible to record and retain the
   dynamic features of ICH through the use of multi-media resources.
   Secondly, Ichpedia can facilitate interactivity between information
   providers and users so that ICH communities, groups and individuals can
   directly access the system as information providers or editors. Using
   the functions of the system, their voices can easily be disseminated to
   the public. Such cooperative work will encourage more awareness and
   identification of the fragility of ICH. Ichpedia will therefore be
   instrumental in improving the understanding of ICH communities and
   individuals and finding better safeguarding methods. Thirdly, Ichpedia
   can reduce the economic burden of establishing a highly efficient
   database system. It is easy and simple to use but offers high efficiency
   compared to other web-based ICH encyclopedias worldwide. Ichpedia has
   the advantage of being the least expensive option for the development
   and maintenance of such a system. Lastly, it is hoped that Ichpedia will
   pave the way for digital innovation in the area of ICH recording with
   the free and open distribution of the digital platform and technologies.},

	abstract = {The profound integration of the digital economy and supply chain (SC) is
   a crucial guarantee for enhancing the resilience and security of new
   energy SC. Existing research mainly focused on the impact of digital
   economy on enterprise internal characteristics, with relatively limited
   attention to the study of multiagent collaboration in the SC. Based on
   data from listed new energy enterprises from 2011 to 2021, this article
   employed a two-way fixed-effects model to explore the impact and
   mechanism of the digital economy on the new energy supply chain
   configuration (SCC). The research reveals that: 1) Digital economy can
   significantly promote the SCC diversified development. After some
   endogeneity tests, the research results remain robust. 2) Digital
   economy can significantly enhance the downstream customer sales
   diversification, with limited impact on upstream supplier procurement.
   Nonstate-owned enterprises in a disadvantaged position are more inclined
   to promote SC diversification through digitization. This impact is more
   pronounced in the eastern region. 3) Digital economy can promote the
   diversified development by improving the supply-demand matching
   accuracy, reducing external transaction costs, and promoting
   technological innovation. The research conclusion and policy suggestions
   can provide a theoretical basis for digital transformation and
   diversified development of new energy enterprises.},

	abstract = {Demand forecast for spare parts in supply chains is essential for
   ensuring customer satisfaction while minimizing appropriate inventory.
   The after-market orders mainly depend on repair and maintenance that
   makes the present problem for demand forecast challenging owing to high
   variability in demand sizes and time intervals. It is critical to
   address market fluctuation for effective demand forecast to reduce the
   risks of oversupply and shortage for supply chain resilience.
   Intelligent data-driven technologies should be developed to promote
   value integration and value co-creation among supply chain partners for
   digital transformation. The shortening product life cycle and the
   reducing lot sizes of diverse products have increased the challenges of
   demand forecast and supply chain management. This study aims to classify
   the demand patterns and develop the corresponding models via stacking
   ensemble approach to improve the overall forecasting performance. This
   study develops an alarm system to monitor the performance of the
   proposed approach and a systematic mechanism for retraining the model to
   maintain the decision quality. An empirical study is conducted in a
   leading automotive after-market component manufacturer for validation in
   real settings. The results have shown the forecast errors and the total
   cost can be effectively reduced by the developed solution.},

	abstract = {Although the term Operational Excellence (OE) has been widely applied
   over the past few decades, its meaning is still ill-defined. This issue
   may be especially aggravated after the advent of the Industry 4.0
   (I4.0), which introduces disruptive digital technologies that may help
   to overcome traditional barriers in operations management. This paper
   examines the concept of OE in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. For
   that, we conducted semi-structured interviews with experts from both
   academia and manufacturing companies, focusing on the shifts in OE's
   concepts implied by the I4.0 with regards to four key aspects (people,
   partnerships, processes, and products and services). Experts' responses
   had their content analysed through the lens of General Systems Theory,
   which allowed the formulation of propositions towards the
   conceptualization of OE in the digital transformation era. Our findings
   indicated that, although some attributes may remain the same, the
   emphasis of OE in the Fourth Industrial Revolution is likely to change.
   The extensive integration of digital technologies into manufacturing
   companies tends to entail different expectations in terms of excellence
   in people, partnerships, processes, and products and services. As
   interconnectivity and cyber-physical systems gain prominence, a more
   integrative and systemic perspective of OE is facilitated, expanding its
   meaning and understanding.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of information technology has promoted the digital
   transformation of the service supply chain. Members can collect, store,
   and transform the value of data to gain profits. Due to the different
   roles during the service delivery, service integrators (SIs) and service
   providers (SPs) transform the data value from different sources, which
   leads to the demand and supply-driven data, respectively. As the leader
   of service supply chain, the SI may show altruistic behavior and share
   the data value with SPs. This study constructs a service supply chain
   consisting of two SPs and one SI and establishes five analytical models.
   Several important conclusions are obtained. First, the demand-driven
   data value leads to a decrease in the SI's optimal pricing and the SP's
   optimal value-added service level, leading to the ``paradox of
   demand-driven data value{''}. Second, supply-driven data value leads to
   the increase in SI and SPs' optimal decisions, and SI can get higher
   expected utility at no cost, achieving the ``free-riding effect{''}.
   Finally, there is a ``transmission effect{''} among the altruistic
   behavior, demand-driven and supply-driven data value. When the
   parameters meet certain condition, customers can obtain an ``optimal
   purchasing area{''} and obtain higher-level value-added service at a
   lower price.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation, uncertain funding and global competition are
   rapidly disrupting higher and vocational educational contexts and
   contributing significantly to the challenges and opportunities of a
   fluid educational environment. To remain relevant for the 21st century
   and to Industry 4.0, educational providers, disciplines and professions
   must anticipate the future world of work and educate today's students as
   tomorrow's graduates with capabilities for work in emerging contexts
   that may not sit within existing roles, disciplines, trades, professions
   or forms of communication. The tertiary sector increasingly seeks to
   navigate these challenges, remain competitive and create engaging
   learning through flexible, integrated and personalised learning
   offerings and pathways, adopting digital learning and multi-modal
   designs and by innovating in curriculum, pedagogies and assessments.
   However, to transform legacy learning environments and practices
   requires academic development that builds capability, resilience and
   agility, as well as an appetite for such transformation within the
   discipline. It requires a cultural transformation toward anticipative
   education both in the profession and in the university. In this article,
   we demonstrate that a framework to scaffold anticipative education does
   enable social work educators to accommodate uncertainty, build
   curriculum flexibility, retain relevance and foster academic resilience

   interface for the next generation of Internet. The potential of the
   Metaverse is growing, as Web 3.0 development and adoption continues to
   advance medicine and healthcare. We define the next generation of
   interoperable healthcare ecosystem in the Metaverse. We examine the
   existing literature regarding the Metaverse, explain the technology
   framework to deliver an immersive experience, along with a technical
   comparison of legacy and novel Metaverse platforms that are publicly
   released and in active use. The potential applications of different
   features of the Metaverse, including avatar-based meetings, immersive
   simulations, and social interactions are examined with different roles
   from patients to healthcare providers and healthcare organizations.
   Present challenges in the development of the Metaverse healthcare
   ecosystem are discussed, along with potential solutions including
   capabilities requiring technological innovation, use cases requiring
   regulatory supervision, and sound governance. This proposed concept and
   framework of the Metaverse could potentially redefine the traditional
   healthcare system and enhance digital transformation in healthcare.
   Similar to AI technology at the beginning of this decade, real-world
   development and implementation of these capabilities are relatively
   nascent. Further pragmatic research is needed for the development of an

	abstract = {This scholarly investigation scrutinizes the involvement of the private
   sector in environmentally sustainable projects, employing the
   cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag methodology on yearly
   data spanning from 2000 to 2020 across 11 low and lower-middle-income
   Asian nations. It specifically assesses the influence of the good
   governance index. Findings indicate a notable correlation, where a 1\%
   enhancement in the index corresponds to a 0.34\% increase in private
   engagement in green projects in the short term and a 0.64\% increase in
   the long term. The study underscores the significance of economic
   stability; a 1\% escalation in uncertainty leads to a 0.56\% short term
   and 0.73\% long-term reduction in private participation. It underscores
   the driving role of gross domestic product growth and the proliferation
   of small and medium-sized enterprises, emphasizing the necessity for
   tailored financial instruments to stimulate private investment in green
   projects. Moreover, it explores practical policy avenues such as
   e-government services, information and communication technology-driven
   digital transformation, sustainable corporate governance, and issuance
   of state-backed green bonds to foster private-sector participation in
   eco-friendly initiatives. Future research avenues encompass examining
   the repercussions of the pandemic on private green investments and
   evaluating the efficacy of the public-private partnership model in green
   projects across these economies.},

	abstract = {Digitalization is transforming industry to an extent that we have only
   seen the beginnings of. Across domains, companies experience rapid
   changes to their existing practices due to new technologies and new
   entrants that current businesses. While digitalization brings endless
   opportunities, it comes with challenges that require companies to
   strategically engage with partners in their surrounding ecosystems. In
   this paper, we study how companies in the embedded systems domain
   experience the process of transitioning from product-based companies to
   businesses where software, data, and artificial intelligence (AI) play
   an increasingly important role. To manage this, these companies need to
   evolve their existing ecosystems while at the same time create new
   ecosystems around new technologies. This involves maintaining existing
   technologies such as mechanics and electronics while at the same time
   expanding these with software, data, and AI. We provide a strategic
   decision framework that helps software-intensive embedded systems
   companies to successfully navigate the digital transformation. We do
   this in two steps. First, we present three models that provide the
   technical content of the strategic decision framework. Second, we
   provide an overview of the strategic alternatives that incumbents and
   new entrants have available when existing technologies are commoditizing
   and new technologies are introduced.},

	abstract = {The construction of the Industrial Internet has become a concrete
   implementation and an essential starting point in accelerating the
   digital transformation and intelligent upgrading of industrial
   manufacturing enterprises. The problem of addressing and forwarding for
   resource-constrained devices restricts data acquisition and
   dissemination on the Industrial Internet. In order to retrieve content
   reasonably, we propose IDEANE, an identity-differentiated content
   acquisition and multipath forwarding scheme with network coding and edge
   computing. In IDEANE, content requests are disseminated based on the
   identity and location information carried in a multi-identifier network,
   which can improve the efficiency of interest message requests and reduce
   idle links in the network. Moreover, the content acquisition computation
   is offloaded to multiple edge nodes, and the encoded data are
   transmitted to the edge nodes for recovery. IDEANE offloads the less
   demanding computing tasks to the edge nodes close to the content
   requesters, to relieve the pressure on providers. In addition, a
   collaboration method among multiple edge nodes is also studied. Multiple
   edge nodes collaborate to support the mobility of content requesters,
   save energy consumption in terminal devices, reduce transmission
   latency, and ensure data security. The experimental results show that
   IDEANE can avoid duplicated transmission, reduce the network link
   overhead, improve network throughput, and enhance network robustness and
   reliability.},

	abstract = {Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has received growing attention within
   the digital transformation as this cutting-edge technology automates
   human behavior and promises high potentials. However, the adoption in
   purchasing and supply management (PSM) is still in its infancy and has
   hardly been explored, particularly in the public sector. Based on a
   multiple case study including 19 organizations of the public and private
   sector, this paper narrows that gap and presents comprehensive insights
   into potentials, barriers, suitable processes, and best practices and
   components for RPA implementation. The findings indicate that adoption
   depends on the orga-nizations' digital procurement readiness and
   maturity. Application areas of RPA enlarge with increasing expe-rience
   and range from transactional and operative tasks within the
   procure-to-pay process to more strategic use cases in sourcing and
   supply relationship management. Potentials mainly comprise employee
   reliefs, cost sav-ings, and increased operational efficiency and
   quality. We uncover multiple technical, organizational, and
   environmental barriers related to IT infrastructure and human resources,
   internal communication, financial resources, top management support,
   organizational structures, supplier-related issues, and government
   regula-tions. Furthermore, our study indicates several differences
   between the private and public sectors for RPA implementation. We
   outline implications for the emerging research on RPA and pivotal
   directions for organi-zational practice.},

	abstract = {PurposeThis study explores how introducing a permissioned blockchain in
   a supply chain context impacts accountability relationships and the
   process of rendering an account. The authors explore how implementing a
   digital transformation impacts the governance of network
   transactions.Design/methodology/approachThe authors mobilize 28
   interviews and documentary analysis. The authors focus on early
   blockchain adopters to get an insight into how implementing a
   permissioned blockchain can transform information sharing, coordination
   and collaboration between business partners, now converted into network
   participants.FindingsThe authors suggest that implementing a
   permissioned blockchain impacts accountability across three levers,
   namely through the ledger, through the code and through the people,
   where these levers are interconnected. Blockchains are often valued for
   their ability to enable transparency through the visibility of
   transactions, but the authors argue that this is an incomplete view.
   Rather, transparency alone does not help to satisfy a duty of
   accountability, as it can result in selective disclosure or
   obfuscation.Originality/valueThe authors extend the conceptualizations
   of accountability in the blockchain literature by focusing on how
   accountability relationships are enacted, and accounts are rendered in a
   permissioned blockchain context. Additionally, the authors complement
   existing work on accountability and governance by suggesting an
   integrated model across three dimensions: ledger, code and people.},

   continuance usage intention among consumers who have used e-payment in
   Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a total of 387 valid samples.
   The overall model was analyzed by structural equation modeling (SEM).
   The empirical results showed that the security, perceived seriousness,
   and perceived usefulness of e-payment significantly affect electronic
   word of mouth (eWOM), while the security and perceived seriousness of
   e-payment have a significant effect on continuance usage intention
   through perceived usefulness and eWOM. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
   e-payment providers should encourage consumers to use e-payment via
   eWOM, perceived usefulness, and consumers' perceived health seriousness
   and should improve the use efficiency of e-payment through e-payment

   through SNA and THA; the evolution of technological co-innovation
   network is analysed by using FP-Growth and the textual analysis, to
   recognise the technology convergence trends; the evolution of the
   factors affecting regional collaborations are discovered by using QAP
   model to analyse the regional co-innovation network. Following
   conclusions are achieved: CMfg co-innovation is centred on state-owned
   enterprises in the power and telecommunication industries, with
   University-Industry collaboration as the main form; the current hot
   spots of CMfg technologies are the Resource Perception-and-Access, the
   Resource Virtualisation-and-Service; the regional collaboration in
   China's CMfg industry tends to be partnership-led and multi-polar. It
   suggests that: In the CMfg industry, more enterprises-supporting policy
   should be made, while the Virtualisation-and-Service technologies need
   more attention, and the partnerships among regions should be further
   enhanced.},

	abstract = {Intelligent logistical systems are crucial for adapting to technological
   advancements and global supply chains, particularly at seaports.
   Automation can maximize port efficiency and adapt to changing
   circumstances, but port digitalisation is challenging due to the various
   parties and information flows involved. The port of Sines in Portugal is
   undergoing a digital transformation, specifically about the Smart Gate
   concept. The port administration and partners have developed a pre-gate,
   which is being examined for operations, technologies, and information
   models. This work uses simulation to analyse the pre-gate model
   dynamically. The discrete-event simulation model, using Anylogic
   software (version 8.9.0), forecasts possible problems and predicts
   pre-gate behaviour, facilitating ongoing enhancement of pre-gate
   procedures. The considered scenarios vary in two factors: the processing
   time at the bottleneck process and the number of active lanes at the
   same point. Four of the twenty tested alternatives were identified as
   balanced. Results allow drawing conclusions on the number of lanes to be
   open to prevent congestion, particularly when processing times increase.
   The study highlights the benefits of simulating complex systems to
   improve operations. Future work could involve adjusting parameters,
   incorporating advanced optimisation techniques, and expanding evaluated
   metrics. The ultimate goal is to develop a reliable digital twin for the
   port.},

	abstract = {Korea's trade policy has proven to be effective in establishing a
   mutually beneficial relationship between international trade and
   economic growth. During the past several decades, Korea has evolved its
   trade approach from a bilateral (export-oriented) focus to a
   multilateral strategy that adheres to the rules of General Agreement on
   Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and WTO. Since the turn of the century, Korea
   has prioritized expanding its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) network, which
   has become a hallmark of its trade policy. This approach has helped the
   country to build stronger relationships with key trading partners and
   increase access to new markets. In response to the evolving global
   environment, Korea has implemented various measures to address new
   challenges while maintaining openness and fairness in global trade.
   Given its high trade-to-GDP ratio, it is crucial for Korea to maintain a
   stable and resilient economic environment. Currently, Korea's trade
   policy centers on strengthening supply chains and integrating itself
   into the reshaping global value chains (GVC). The country is also
   contributing to global rule-making, with a particular focus on digital
   transformation and the net-zero transition. Moreover, Korea is committed
   to deepening and upgrading existing FTAs while expanding and
   complementing them, recognizing their significance as platforms for
   cooperation and communication with other countries.},

	abstract = {Technological advancements associated with Industry 4.0 drive a paradigm
   shift with economic and social consequences where digitalization,
   robotization, and other emerging technologies reshape the
   interconnection between organizations. Critical areas that need to adapt
   to the change are inter-organizational buyer-supplier relationships
   managed by Purchasing and Supply Management (PSM) professionals. That
   is, their future responsibilities and skills are likely to change.
   Introducing the concept of specialized roles to summarize needed
   competencies, this research conducted a real-time Delphi study using an
   internet-based platform involving 47 procurement experts. As a result,
   the roles of the Data Analyst, Master Data Manager, Process Automation
   Manager, Supplier Onboarding Manager, System Innovation Scout, and
   Legislation Specialist were identified as essential Industry 4.0 PSM
   roles. For these roles, the probability of their occurrence, industry
   impact, desirability, and level of industry adoption are assessed. Based
   on emerging technologies in PSM and adopting a humancentered
   perspective, this research shows the need to focus on talent development
   to enable a technologydriven revolution. Thus, the contributions lay in
   the literature on Industry 4.0 and the PSM skills and capabilities

	abstract = {Sustainability innovation is often not achievable by a single
   organisation; even if changes in business operations can lead to great
   advances towards a more sustainable business model (SBM), the
   effectiveness of these implementations largely depends on the combined
   actions of the organisation's network of partners. The aim of this
   research is to analyse the way that SBMs and partnerships co-evolve to
   enhance the sustainability of the involved organisations and spread
   sustainability culture beyond the network. In doing so, this article
   presents a case study of the company Alisea as a business operating
   within a circular business model, along with its network of
   partnerships. The co-evolution of the business model and partnerships is
   led by enabling factors that characterise the underlying relationships.
   The role of cross-sector collaborations is demonstrated in terms of
   boosting the social and environmental dimensions of the circular
   business model, enhancing social and economic benefits within and

	abstract = {Purpose Widespread efforts to promote the use of building information
   modelling (BIM) as part of the construction industry transformation
   agenda in many advanced countries are yet to reach the wished-for
   effects. While there are various studies on the factors influencing BIM
   adoption, empirical evidence detailing how construction companies can
   successfully adopt BIM in their organisations remains scarce. This paper
   identifies and describes how enabling factors are implemented by large
   UK contractor firms to transform their organisations using BIM for
   projects. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative exploratory approach
   is employed in this paper. Data are gathered through 42 semi-structured
   interviews with professionals in strategic and management roles in
   construction companies in the UK, followed by case studies of five
   leading main contractor companies selected to provide examples of how
   they implemented the identified enablers. Findings This research
   identifies and describes six key enabling factors that influence
   successful BIM adoption and implementation, namely, committed leadership
   and management; a digital transformation strategy with realistic
   objectives; building a capable supplier network; building trust-based
   relationships with clients; upskilling employees; and establishing a
   robust structure for effective collaboration and communication.
   Practical implications Nine practical recommendations are provided to
   guide construction firms in taking steps to adopt and use BIM in their
   organisations and for their projects. Originality/value This study
   provides empirical evidence detailing how key enablers are implemented
   towards successful BIM adoption and use by large UK contractors.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaping the future of the automotive
   industry. Grounded on the advances in everything from sensors,
   electronic controllers, artificial intelligence, data analytics, to
   network connectivity, intelligent connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs)
   have become the essence in IoT applications. The software in CAVs lies
   at the core of this digital transformation. Faulty software remains the
   main reason behind the vast number of safety recalls and reputation
   damage witnessed recently in the automotive industry. The uniqueness of
   CAVs originates challenges for vehicle software engineering (VSE) that
   render traditional models and practical solutions for software
   development ineffective and inapplicable. Despite the raised necessity
   to adopt a software engineering model that can handle these challenges,
   there is a lack of studies recognizing the importance of VSE. This
   article presents an in-depth and comprehensive analysis to perceive the
   existing software engineering processes detailing their strengths and
   limitations in the context of CAVs. It also reviews current practical
   software solutions, including standards, tools, languages, and research
   efforts to understand the evolution, trends, and current practice in
   this article area. This article will enable automakers and software
   providers to better assess and differentiate among the existing software
   engineering processes and current practical solutions for vehicle
   software system development. Hence, they would be able to adopt a VSE
   model and follow best practices that can better meet their challenging
   needs.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper presents the findings from the assessment of the
   determinants of cloud computing (CC) deployment by construction
   organisations. Using the technology-organisation-environment (TOE)
   framework, the study strives to improve construction organisations'
   project delivery and digital transformation by adopting beneficial
   technologies like CC. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a
   post-positivism philosophical stance using a deductive approach with a
   questionnaire administered to construction organisations in South
   Africa. The data gathered were analysed using descriptive and
   inferential statistics. Also, the fusion of structural equation
   modelling (SEM) and machine learning (ML) regression models helped to
   gain a robust understanding of the key determinants of using CC.
   Findings The study found that the use of CC by construction
   organisations in South Africa is still slow. SEM indicated that this
   slow usage is influenced by six technology and environmental factors,
   namely (1) cost-effectiveness, (2) availability, (3) compatibility, (4)
   client demand, (5) competitors' pressure and (6) trust in cloud service
   providers. ML models developed affirmed that these variables have high
   predictive power. However, sensitivity analysis revealed that the
   availability of CC and CC's ancillary technologies and the pressure from
   competitors are the most important predictors of CC usage in
   construction organisations. Originality/value The paper offers a
   theoretical backdrop for future works on CC in construction,
   particularly in developing countries where such a study has not been
   explored.},

	abstract = {In today's rapidly evolving business environment, firms are striving to
   enhance their ability to respond swiftly to changing market conditions.
   To address this challenge, the strategic use of collaborative
   information systems has emerged as a key factor, particularly within
   supply chain management. Supply chain partners collaborate through these
   systems to improve decision-making quality, optimize supply chain
   networks, and response uncertainties. Given that most collaborative
   workflows occur in these systems, the effectiveness of a organization's
   response is heavily influenced by the quality of systems. Consequently,
   this study examines the quality factors of collaborative systems and the
   structural relationships to organizational agility and corporate
   performance. In addition, our research is focused on the concept of
   organizational agility within the context of digital transformation and
   the post-COVID era, integrating perspectives from information systems,
   organizational behavior, and strategic management. The study finds that
   information quality is crucial for information collaboration, while
   service quality significantly impacts operational collaboration.
   Emphasizing the importance of comprehensive operational integration, the
   research aligns with recent literature on the role of integrated
   business processes in enhancing organizational agility and performance.
   The findings underscore the necessity for a balanced approach in
   collaborative system development, highlighting the importance of both
   information and service quality in optimizing collaboration and
   improving organizational outcomes in the digital age.},

	abstract = {The rise of the e-commerce industry has markedly changed the global
   economy, providing customers with unparalleled access to goods and
   services. This study empirically examines online shoppers' perceptions
   and preferences, focusing on their experiences with last-mile delivery
   (LMD) services and its impact on their shopping behaviour. This research
   employs machine learning classification and regression models for a
   large-scale analysis of customers' responses, collected using an online
   survey in the main cities in Saudi Arabia, which is experiencing rapid
   e-commerce growth amidst a broader digital transformation. The findings
   highlight a strong consumer preference for timely LMD services,
   typically within a day of purchase, while noting dissatisfaction with
   exceedingly early delivery windows. The research emphasises the need to
   address customer dissatisfaction with delivery services to retain
   clientele, as many may switch retailers without informing the retailers.
   Additionally, a considerable trend towards preferring digital over
   cash-on-delivery payment methods was observed among online shoppers.
   Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the significant
   influence of LMD services on customer satisfaction and behaviour in the
   e-commerce sector. The use of robust machine learning models has
   revealed critical factors that can guide retailers and LMD providers in
   enhancing service delivery and customer experience, contributing to the

	abstract = {Research Summary Firms implement digital technology for improving
   coordination and communication in cross-border R\&D alliances. However,
   there is great ambivalence regarding how digitalization influences
   cross-border knowledge transfers. Our analysis clarifies some of this
   ambivalence by providing different configurations of absorptive capacity
   in cross-border R\&D alliances. The fuzzy-set qualitative comparative
   analysis (fsQCA) reveals only low absorptive capacity achievement in
   most configurations of digital technology implementation. The findings
   indicate effects of cognitive digitalization biases, under which firms
   take the benefits of digital technology for granted while ignoring
   deep-level challenges rooted in the contextuality of international ties.
   However, high absorptive capacity is achievable when (1) allying with
   bigger and younger partners, (2) under technological similarity, and (3)
   coping with the associated digitalization biases. Managerial Summary
   Firms are eager to grasp the potential of digital technology. Within
   R\&D alliances, digital technology is deemed to facilitate better
   coordination and communication. However, advantages from digital
   transformation are not always realized, as firms may overestimate the
   ease and usability of the underpinning technologies. We find that
   learning and understanding of partner knowledge is improved when R\&D
   partnerships are forged between bigger and smaller partners, when
   partners feature technological similarities and both parties are
   similarly minded regarding technologies and do not take technology
   advantages for granted.},

	abstract = {Managing supply chain (SC) relationships to deal with challenges posed
   by contemporary social and business environments is a difficult task
   that can be facilitated with the use of digital technologies. The
   growing complexity of supply chains, characterized by over-dependencies
   on geographically dispersed partners across different regions, increases
   risks related to managing these relationships and highlights the
   importance of collaboration and balancing the power dynamics between SC
   partners. Previous studies have shown that small and medium enterprises
   (SMEs) can be considered the weakest link in terms of digitization and
   balance of power. This article aims to analyse how buyer-seller power
   relations moderate the relationship between the adoption of digital
   technologies in supply chain management (SCM) processes and innovation
   performance in the context of SMEs. Data were collected from
   manufacturing SMEs operating in Portugal. The results support the
   assumption that the use of digital technologies in processes related to
   SCM has a positive effect on SMEs innovation performance. The results

	abstract = {The digital transformation sets new requirements to all classes of
   enterprise systems in companies. ERP systems in particular, which
   represent the dominant class of enterprise systems, are struggling to
   meet the new requirements at all levels of the architecture. Therefore,
   there is an urgent need to reconsider the overall architecture of the
   systems and address the root of the related issues. Given that many
   restrictions ERP pose on their adaptability are related to the
   standardization of data, the database layer of ERP systems is addressed.
   Since database serve as the foundation for data storage and retrieval,
   they limit the flexibility of enterprise systems and the chance to adapt
   to new requirements accordingly. So far, relational databases are widely
   used. Using a systematic literature approach, recent requirements for
   ERP systems were identified. Prominent database approaches were assessed
   against the 23 requirements identified. The results reveal the strengths
   and weaknesses of recent database approaches. To this end, the results
   highlight the demand to combine multiple database approaches to fulfill
   recent business requirements. From a conceptual point of view, this
   paper supports the idea of federated databases which are interoperable
   to fulfill future requirements and support business operation. This
   research forms the basis for renewal of the current generation of ERP
   systems and proposes to ERP vendors to use different database concepts
   in the future.},

	abstract = {The global gambling sector has grown significantly over recent years due
   to liberal deregulation and digital transformation. Likewise, concerns
   around gambling-related harms-experienced by individuals, their
   families, their local communities or societies-have also developed, with
   growing calls that they should be addressed by a public health approach.
   A public health approach towards gambling-related harms requires a
   multifaceted strategy, comprising initiatives promoting health
   protection, harm minimization and health surveillance across different
   strata of society. However, there is little research exploring how a
   public health approach to gambling-related harms can learn from similar
   approaches to other potentially harmful but legal sectors such as the
   alcohol sector, the tobacco sector, and the high in fat, salt and sugar
   product sector. Therefore, this paper presents a conceptual framework
   that was developed following a scoping review of public health
   approaches towards the above sectors. Specifically, we synthesize
   strategies from each sector to develop an overarching set of public
   health goals and strategies which-when interlinked and incorporated with
   a socio-ecological model-can be deployed by a range of stakeholders,
   including academics and treatment providers, to minimise
   gambling-related harms. We demonstrate the significance of the
   conceptual framework by highlighting its use in mapping initiatives as
   well as unifying stakeholders towards the minimization of
   gambling-related harms, and the protection of communities and societies
   alike.},

	abstract = {Individual preferences are formed within intricate social relationships
   and would be influenced by others' opinions, especially in large-scale
   groups, resulting in social network large-scale group decision-making
   (SNLGDM). As the bridges for the interaction of decision makers (DMs),
   trust relationships should dynamically evolve with opinions during the
   decision-making process. However, traditional methods often rely on
   static social networks and ignore the impact of historical preferences
   of DMs. Therefore, this study develops a SNLGDM model incorporating
   dynamic social network, an improved Hegselmann and Krause (HK) model,
   and historical preferences of DMs to enhance the effectiveness of
   opinion evolution. First, the initial social network of DMs is
   constructed by combining the bidirectional and unidirectional trust
   relationships optimized by the trust propagation model. Then, the
   dynamic updating mechanisms of the network including trust
   relationships, confidence sets and relative weights of DMs are designed
   to ensure the trustworthy interactions. Furthermore, a SNLGDM framework
   based on VIKOR is proposed, in which, the opinion information is
   quantified as the Dual hesitant fuzzy sets (DHFSs) and fused by an
   improved HK model that considers historical preferences of DMs to
   effectively capture the evolving preferences and reduce information
   distortion. Finally, the supplier selection for the digital
   transformation consultation service is established as the case study,
   and the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are
   validated through results and comparison analysis.},

   supply chains of manufacturers and suppliers in the automotive industry.
   Furthermore, the digitalization of the production process changed how
   manufacturing firms manage their value chains in the era of Industry
   4.0. The automotive sector represents the ecosystem with rapid digital
   transformation, which provides a strong relationship between
   manufacturing firms in supply chains. However, there are many gaps in
   understanding how digital technologies and services could better shape
   relations between manufacturers and suppliers in the automotive
   industry. Accordingly, this study investigates the relations in
   deliveries of digital services in supply chains of the automotive
   industry. The data set was obtained through annual reports of the
   automotive firms, both from suppliers and manufacturers, between 2018
   and 2020. From the network perspective, throughout the years, authors
   have used Social Network Analysis (SNA) method. SNA evaluates the
   relationship between actors (i.e., manufacturers and suppliers) in the
   use of services in their business models. The research results
   demonstrate how suppliers influence car manufacturers to deliver digital
   services to their customers. Finally, this study provides information
   that the combination of digital technologies with product-related
   services enables a stronger relationship between manufacturers and
   suppliers in the manufacturing ecosystem. These relations support the

	abstract = {With the increasing adoption of Big Data technologies as basic tools for
   the ongoing Digital Transformation, there is a high demand for
   data-intensive applications. In order to efficiently execute such
   applications, it is vital that cloud providers change the way hardware
   infrastructure resources are managed to improve their performance.
   However, the increasing use of virtualization technologies to achieve an
   efficient usage of infrastructure resources continuously widens the gap
   between applications and the underlying hardware, thus decreasing
   resource efficiency for the end user. Moreover, this scenario is
   especially troublesome for Big Data applications, as storage resources
   are one of the most heavily virtualized, thus imposing a significant
   overhead for large-scale data processing. This paper proposes a novel
   PaaS architecture specifically oriented for Big Data where the scheduler
   offers disks as resources alongside the more common CPU and memory
   resources, looking forward to provide a better storage solution for the
   user. Furthermore, virtualization overheads are reduced to the bare
   minimum by replacing heavy hypervisor-based technologies with
   operating-system-level virtualization based on light software
   containers. This architecture has been deployed on a Big Data
   infrastructure at the CESGA supercomputing center, used as a testbed to
   compare its performance with OpenStack, a popular private cloud
   platform. Results have shown significant performance improvements,
   reducing the execution time of representative Big Data workloads by up
   to 4.5x.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to deepen the understanding of the service
   design concept by critically analyzing the existing servitization
   literature. The paper's main purpose is to structure service design and
   offer a clear understanding of how it should be applied.
   Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted
   within servitization literature to understand the evolution of the
   service design concept. The authors use service design pillars (i.e.
   user-centered, co-creative, sequencing, evidencing and holistic) as a
   theoretical framework to explain how service design should be
   effectively incorporated into the servitization journey. Findings The
   findings expose a discordant interpretation of the pillars underpinning
   service design, revealing a paradoxical comprehension that jeopardizes
   its practical advancement within the servitization literature. The
   authors propose that service design should first be seen holistically,
   then target user-centered practices for sequencing service development
   steps, and finally, co-creating with partners to make the service
   evident to users. Furthermore, the authors contextualize service design
   within contemporary and traditional service-related issues such as
   servitization innovation, customer experience, service-dominant logic,
   service ecosystems and digital transformation. Originality/value This
   research pinpoints the service design concept's shortcomings in the
   servitization literature. The study promotes a critical reflection on
   the service design concept and its current application, providing
   avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the importance of smart manufacturing in the context
   of Industry 4.0, highlighting the crucial role of Manufacturing
   Execution Systems (MESs) in facilitating Industry 4.0, particularly in
   data capture and process management. It is worth noting that Small and
   Medium Enterprises (SMEs) face several obstacles, unlike large companies
   that have the resources to adopt these principles. This text explores
   the challenges that SMEs encounter when adopting Industry 4.0,
   considering budget constraints and technology transfer difficulties. The
   potential benefits of such projects are often difficult to measure
   during the initial stages, but they can facilitate the digital
   transformation of small businesses. To support this thesis, this paper
   presents an example of MES implementation in a manufacturing SME,
   showcasing the creation of a comprehensive data monitoring and
   industrial performance assessment system. This paper aims to introduce a
   systematic approach for integrating a Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
   framework using MESs within an SME. This paper highlights the importance
   of transitioning from big data to smart data to achieve outcomes in
   terms of operational efficiency, cost analysis, workload management,
   resource utilisation, knowledge dissemination, and enhanced operator
   engagement.},

	abstract = {Peer providers play a crucial role in the growth and sustainability of
   the sharing economy. However, the psychology and behavior of peer
   providers who assume the role of suppliers on sharing economy platforms
   have received insufficient attention in the literature. This study
   proposes a model that examines the role of warm glow emotion, perceived
   economic, social, and environmental benefits, and trust beliefs on
   attitudes and supply intentions on the platform. An online
   scenario-based survey involving 361 platform users was conducted, and
   data were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation
   modeling technique. The results indicate that warm glow feelings
   positively influence peer-provider participation. A strong warm glow
   feeling can also reduce decision-making complexity by enhancing trust
   and attitudes towards sharing. Perceived social benefits emerge as the
   strongest predictor of attitudes, followed by trust beliefs and
   perceived economic benefits; surprisingly, the influence of perceived
   environmental benefits is dismissed. This study contributes to the
   sharing economy literature by elucidating the key emotional and
   psychological factors that precede peer-provider participation. It
   extends the warm glow-giving theory and emotion literature to contexts
   beyond charitable and environmental acts. Practical insights are
   discussed for planning and designing strategies to target peer
   providers.},

	abstract = {Supported by a third-party capacity sharing platform, manufacturers can
   share capacities with others to match the rapidly changing demand. Both
   the capacity requestor and the capacity provider can choose to seek or
   wait for matches, forming different trading strategies (capacity- and
   demand-driven strategies). Based on the game and chaos theories, this
   paper analyzes the preference of the capacity provider, the capacity
   requestor, and the capacity platform operator on different trading
   strategies from the aspects of profitability and stability. It finds
   that the platform operator values stability much more than
   profitability, although the latter may reach higher optimal expected
   profits. The preference of each supply chain member is influenced by the
   production cost, potential market size, and the limited capacity of the
   capacity requestor. A stable system can result in higher long-run
   profits than a profitable system. We further propose the all-win
   situation for the capacity provider, capacity requestor, and platform

	abstract = {Procurement is a widely adopted collaborative approach for acquiring new
   systems in the public sector. It exemplifies a situation in which the
   early stages of digital system design define the boundaries and
   constraints of a new system that must be specified in the tender
   document (i.e., a binding offer). Researchers and government officials
   have long recognized the benefit of end-user participation in system
   design. Given the central role of the pre-tender phases in procurement
   processes, however, there is a need to better understand what affects
   user participation in such early stages. In this paper, we research a
   procurement process in municipal Child Welfare Services in Norway. We
   focus on caseworkers' participation in procuring a future case
   management system. We build on the concept of participatory
   infrastructuring to characterize how the meaning of participation was
   shaped through three overarching participatory infrastructuring
   practices of decision-making within a rigid procurement process: (i)
   scaling up the project, (ii) negotiating participation in meetings with
   potential suppliers and in tender documents, and (iii) positioning
   caseworkers as subject experts. The analysis of these practices reveals
   that the definition of user needs in the tender documentation and the
   creation of knotworks define both the boundary conditions and the
   modalities of participation. We contribute to the conversation on
   participatory infrastructuring in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work by
   discussing how participatory infrastructuring provides a conceptual
   understanding of participation in the context of municipal systems
   procurement.},

   (GSCM). For the first time, using the SDG mapping algorithms, this
   article focused on 7009 publications from 2013 to 2022 mapped explicitly
   to 17 SDGs. This study uses bibliometric and science mapping techniques
   to create a detailed mapping between GSCM research and SDGs. This study
   created an SDG citation network to show how specific SDGs are related to
   GSCM practices. The most mapped SDGs in this study are SDG 9 (Industry,
   Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and
   Production), and SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals). Our results showed
   that GSCM research mainly focuses on three thematic areas: industry 4.0
   and sustainable supply chains, GSCM practice coordination, and
   sustainable environmental policy management. This also includes
   integrating the circular economy into GSCM, sustainable sourcing, supply
   chain resilience, digital transformation in GSCM for better
   environmental performance, and the social impact of GSCM. A shift
   towards integrating sustainability into supply chain processes has been
   found. Environmental management, performance monitoring, and new
   technologies like Industry 4.0 and AI have been used to support the
   SDGs. International interest and collaboration in GSCM research can be
   seen from the bibliographic coupling study covering countries like
   Europe, Western Countries, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Eastern
   Europe. This study shows how GSCM can directly address global challenges
   identified by the United Nations by mapping GSCM research to specific

	abstract = {The exceptional COVID-19 crisis has shown the fragility of the health
   supply chain and the need for its digital transformation. However,
   digitization initiatives for healthcare supply chain have focused mainly
   on the hospital as a central point of consumption as well as on the
   relationship between the hospital and its suppliers. Thus, unlike
   previous studies that have focused on the digitalization of the internal
   supply chain of hospitals, this article is centered on the
   digitalization of external trajectories, particularly, the home care
   medical supply chain. This perspective complements the hospital-centric
   model, in which logistics activities are analyzed only from the point of
   view of the focal actor, which is the hospital. In order to understand
   this contemporary phenomenon embedded in a local context, we have
   conducted an in-depth case study. Based on an enriched model of the
   digital supply chain developed by Queiroz et al. (2021), this article
   offers for the first time a deep understanding and digitalization
   initiatives of the home care medical supply chain. The research
   proposals can guide logistics managers and nurses on their initiatives
   of digitalization of the home care medical supply chain, and further
   strengthen the healthcare development. This article draws the attention
   of healthcare stakeholders to the importance of efforts in the
   digitalization of external trajectories, thus allowing the healthcare
   system to adapt to the growing needs of elderly people and people with
   physical or mental disabilities.},

	abstract = {The use of digital financial innovations (DFIs) in firms is widespread
   for supply or demand reasons. Successful realization of DFIs requires a
   digital transformation of the organizations. To date, there is hardly
   any study that discusses the organizational or strategic antecedents of
   DFIs in organizations. This study uses the organizational readiness and
   strategic alignment theories to understand how various dimensions of
   organizational readiness (change valence, change efficacy, and
   contextual factors) influence DFIs. The study also informs about the
   moderation effect of digital technology - business strategy alignment on
   the relationship between organizational readiness and DFIs. We find that
   the organization's change efficacy (comprising of resource readiness, IT
   readiness, and cognitive readiness) and contextual factors (comprising
   of culture readiness, strategic readiness, and partnership readiness)
   positively influence DFIs. However, no support is found for the
   moderation effect of digital technology - business strategy. We also
   find that DFIs positively impact the firms' financial performance and
   resilience (robustness and adaptability). The results are informative
   for practitioners and theoreticians. For practitioners, the study
   informs that realizing DFIs in organizations requires reconfigurability
   and flexibility of resources, IT, strategy, collaborations, and
   organization culture. Moreover, DFIs offer financial resilience to the
   firms to absorb financial shocks. For theoreticians, one crucial finding
   is that in a developing economy context, digital technology - business
   strategy alignment does not play a moderation role in realizing DFIs,
   which may not be the case in the developed economies and merits further
   research.},

   Things, digital transformation and artificial intelligence will
   transition organizations from their current wild west of predictive
   analytics to an environment that begins to resemble the American science
   fiction domain of Westworld. In this new domain, referred to here as an
   era of the `Analytics of Things,' (AoT) business to business
   relationships will change dramatically and dynamically. New types of
   data and analytics contracts will be needed, and academic research on
   preferred negotiation strategies to realize preferred contract scenarios
   is required. This collaborative effort with the SIM Advanced Practices
   Council establishes early thought leadership for the emerging Analytics
   of Things. Findings from this research provide recommendations on
   contract provisions in different scenarios, and they inform AoT
   ecosystem partners on issues including, 1) infrastructure capacity and
   communication channel costs can increase exponentially when data and
   analytics are shared among partners, 2) early entrant data co-ownership
   advantages exist when shared data remains shared after a contract ends,
   3) well-designed garbage collection processes for a partnering ecosystem
   are needed when data does not remain shared after contracts end, 4) when
   partners share analytical models and data ownership, there needs to be
   adequate communications capacity to handle expected update and data
   transfer volatility and 5) democratization of data and analytics
   ownership in an ecosystem with many partners comes at a higher cost in
   infrastructure and communication loads than if data and analytics remain

	abstract = {The healthcare sector is experiencing a digital transformation propelled
   by the Internet of Medical Things (IOMT), real-time patient monitoring,
   robotic surgery, Electronic Health Records (EHR), medical imaging, and
   wearable technologies. This proliferation of digital tools generates
   vast quantities of healthcare data. Efficient and timely analysis of
   this data is critical for enhancing patient outcomes and optimizing care
   delivery. Real-time processing of Healthcare Big Data (HBD) offers
   significant potential for improved diagnostics, continuous monitoring,
   and effective surgical interventions. However, conventional cloud-based
   processing systems face challenges due to the sheer volume and
   time-sensitive nature of this data. The migration of large datasets to
   centralized cloud infrastructures often results in latency, which
   impedes real-time applications. Furthermore, network congestion
   exacerbates these challenges, delaying access to vital insights
   necessary for informed decision-making. Such limitations hinder
   healthcare professionals from fully leveraging the capabilities of
   emerging technologies and big data analytics. To mitigate these issues,
   this paper proposes a Regional Computing (RC) paradigm for the
   management of HBD. The RC framework establishes strategically positioned
   regional servers capable of regionally collecting, processing, and
   storing medical data, thereby reducing dependence on centralized cloud
   resources, especially during peak usage periods. This innovative
   approach effectively addresses the constraints of traditional cloud
   processing, facilitating real-time data analysis at the regional level.
   Ultimately, it empowers healthcare providers with the timely information
   required to deliver data-driven, personalized care and optimize
   treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {Purpose The study aims to investigate whether and how digital
   transformation, in terms of digital collaboration, joint efforts with
   internal/external partners to achieve common goals and the adoption of
   digital tools supporting this practice, affect social innovation capital
   in the context of small innovative enterprises (SIEs).
   Design/methodology/approach The research hypotheses derived from the
   analysis of the literature, evaluating how sharing resources, sharing
   intensity and digital patterns affect the collective capacity of SIEs to
   innovate, were investigated by applying multiple regression analysis.
   Data were retrieved from a sample of Italian SIEs through an online
   survey. Findings The main findings suggest that the propensity to spread
   resources and the sharing intensity positively affect the collective
   capacity of SIEs to innovate. Also, the effect of resources sharing on
   collective innovation increases as more digital patterns are used as
   tools. The connection is weaker for the intensity of resources sharing.
   Research limitations/implications The study is conducted on Italian
   SIEs, a particular cluster of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It
   would be interesting to compare and contrast the results of an analysis
   of a large sample of international companies, of different sizes and
   belonging to digital and non-digital sectors. Originality/value The
   results enrich the existing literature on social innovation capital, by
   clarifying its competitive benefits on the characteristic context of the
   SIEs and underlining the mediating role of the digital patterns.},

	abstract = {With cross-border data flows being central to the African Union's
   digital transformation, African countries have adopted varied approaches
   to governing data transfers. We categorize these approaches into three
   regulatory models-open, conditional, and control-reflecting frameworks
   promoted by the USA, the European Union, and China, respectively. Using
   a gravity model, we assess how these models, along with comprehensive
   data protection laws, influence intra-regional trade in digital
   services. Our findings show that countries following the US-inspired
   open model experience higher trade volumes with other African trade
   partners, while the widespread adoption of the EU-inspired conditional
   model negatively impacts intra-regional digital trade. We do not find
   significant effects for the China-inspired control model. Additionally,
   we find that the adoption of a comprehensive data protection law, which
   in the region is often modelled after the EU's General Data Protection
   Regulation, correlates negatively with trade, particularly for
   lower-income countries, potentially due to the cost burden of
   compliance. In the context of the recent commitment to open data flows
   undertaken by African Union members in the African Continental Free
   Trade Area's Digital Trade Protocol, we estimate that open data flows
   could boost intra-regional digital services trade by 10.3\%, or around
   125 million USD. When developing regional data rules, we recommend that
   policymakers consider the unique needs of lower-income countries and
   provide technical assistance to face compliance costs.},

	abstract = {Industries nowadays try their best to remain competitive in a
   manufacturing world that undergoes a digital transformation driven by
   smart technology and connected devices. Profit margins quickly shift
   from products to services, and thus the manufacturing sector industries
   try to shift from offering products to offering industrial product
   service systems (IPSS) in order to keep up to date and ensure their
   market position and economic success. IPSS is a well-rounded solution
   consisting of the tangible part which is the product and an intangible
   one being the service. IPSS are efficient and beneficiary not only for
   the provider but also for the user and even the environment. IPSS is not
   a simple process of adding services to traditional products but a rather
   more complex integration process of the mechanical product, sensors, and
   IoT and software, which are coupled with supportive systems (resources
   and infrastructures) and the involvement of heterogeneous stakeholders.
   Due to the high complexity involved in the development and production
   process of IPSS, tools for IPSS production planning and installation in
   a dynamic and collaborative environment are extremely essential for
   manufacturing firms, but they are however absent. In this paper, a
   methodology for conducting resource planning for the production and
   installation of IPSS is proposed, and according to this, the
   architecture of a cloud-based tool is developed. A real-life pilot case
   from a laser and sheet metal machinery production industry is presented
   where the developed tool was tested and validated upon its results.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) holds significant potential for the architecture,
   engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. However, its adoption by
   AEC enterprises remains relatively low. VR adoption is affected by many
   factors, and critical factors play essential roles and actively
   influence the adoption according to specific paths. Therefore, it is
   necessary to identify these critical factors and paths to improve VR
   adoption. However, there is currently a lack of research on key
   influencing factors and paths for AEC enterprises, which greatly hinders
   VR adoption. To bridge this gap, this study aims to identify the key
   influencing factors and critical paths for VR adoption in AEC
   enterprises, focusing on the organizational level. Drawing on the
   technology-organization-environment (TOE) theory, we categorize and
   analyze the factors affecting VR adoption. Through a questionnaire
   survey, we establish a direct connection between these factors and
   construct an adjacency matrix. Subsequently, we employ social network
   analysis (SNA) to visualize the social network relationship diagram and
   analyze network measures. Our findings reveal six critical factors and
   four critical paths that significantly influence VR adoption. By
   integrating the TOE-SNA method, this study quantifies the interaction
   relationship among various factors and identifies critical factors and
   paths, providing a theoretical foundation for VR adoption in AEC
   enterprises. Moreover, our research offers practical guidance for
   government, enterprises, and VR product suppliers to promote VR
   adoption, enhance adoption rates, and contribute to the long-term
   development of the industry in the digital transformation era.},

	abstract = {In the railway domain, rolling stock maintenance affects service
   operation time and efficiency. Minimizing train unavailability is
   essential for reducing capital loss and operational costs. To this aim,
   prediction of failures of rolling stock equipment is crucial to
   proactively trigger proper maintenance activities. Indeed, predictive
   maintenance is a golden example of the digital transformation within
   Industry 4.0, which affects several engineering processes in the railway
   domain. Nowadays, it may leverage artificial intelligence and machine
   learning algorithms to forecast failures and schedule the optimal time
   for maintenance actions. Generally, rail systems deteriorate gradually
   over time or fail directly, leading to data that vary extremely slowly.
   Indeed, ML approaches for predictive maintenance should consider this
   type of data to accurately predict and forecast failures.This paper
   proposes a methodology based on Long Short-Term Memory deep learning
   algorithms for predictive maintenance of railway rolling stock
   equipment. The methodology allows us to properly learn long-term
   dependencies for gradually changing data, and both predicting and
   forecasting failures of rail equipment. In the framework of an
   academic-industrial partnership, the methodology is experimented on a
   train traction converter cooling system, demonstrating its applicability
   and benefits. The results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
   methods, reaching a failure prediction and forecasting accuracy over
   99\%, with a false alarm rate of similar to 0.4\% and a mean absolute
   error in the order of 10-4, respectively.},

	abstract = {Pediatric ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgery is very common, and its
   outcomes may improve with family education. In this regard, mobile
   health (mHealth) applications (apps), which are on the rise due to
   digital transformation, can be beneficial in healthcare. This study
   outlines the user-centered design and development of a mHealth app
   (version 5.15.0) to support family caregivers during the perioperative
   process of pediatric ENT surgery. Conducted over two years in an Italian
   maternal and child health hospital (January 2020-May 2022), the study
   employed a participatory design method based on the Information System
   Research (ISR) framework and guided by the principles of Slow Medicine.
   Utilizing the Relevance, Rigor, and Design cycles of the ISR framework,
   the mHealth app's content, functionalities, and technical features were
   defined and developed. A committee of fifteen experts guided the process
   with input from 25 family caregivers and 24 healthcare providers
   enrolled in the study. The mHealth app content was structured around
   five crucial educational moments characterizing the ENT perioperative
   period, providing evidence-based information on surgical procedures,
   strategies for preparing children for hospitalization and surgery, pain
   management, and post-discharge care. The mHealth app featured a function
   that sends customized notifications to guide caregivers at specific
   perioperative stages. The development of mHealth apps by implementing a
   rigorous, participatory, and Slow design process can foster accessible
   and family-centered information and care in the field of maternal and
   child health and beyond.},

	abstract = {With the digital transformation of the global economy, a new mode of
   knowledge service has emerged on open innovation platforms such as those
   for the sharing economy. This mode is the paid knowledge-sharing
   service, where knowledge providers share knowledge with only those who
   have paid for it. Since an individual customer `s purchases are
   influenced by others around them, we adopted social in fluence theory to
   explain sales of such services on paid knowledge-sharing platforms. A
   machine learning approach was applied to analyze 27,223 text reviews
   from the Zhihu Live platform (a well-known and large-scale open
   knowledge community in China). Hierarchical regression models were built
   to verify twelve proposed hypotheses about the knowledge providers,
   knowledge quality, interaction quality, and ratings. The results con
   firm the positive effect on sales of responsiveness (a dimension of
   interaction quality), and the negative effect on sales of free
   provider-driven knowledge contributions. In summary, this study provides
   a comprehensive framework for antecedent factors of sales of
   knowledge-sharing services. By introducing to knowledge management
   notions from the field of e-commerce (e.g., price, quality), this study
   broadens the understanding of the free-to-paid phenomenon on
   knowledge-sharing platforms. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

	abstract = {The advent of the Fifth Generation Mobile Network (5G) deployments and
   the anticipation of the Sixth Generation Mobile Network (6G) have
   spurred a concerted effort towards defining new network and application
   services that harness the potential of these technologies. One of these
   key technologies is deterministic networking, which has emerged as a
   focal point, offering reliability, time sensitivity, and predictability,
   crucial for supporting critical services and applications. In this
   article, we present our tailored extensions to the Experimental Studies
   (SLICES)-Madrid testbed to support multi-domain deterministic
   communications research, enabling the union of different
   technology-specific deterministic networking solutions, namely Institute
   of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11, IEEE 802.1 Time
   Sensitive Networking (TSN), and Third Generation Partnership Project
   (3GPP) 5G domains, over an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) overlay data plane. Our endeavor aims
   to provide a realistic infrastructure for developing the next generation
   of deterministic services. Key contributions include the design,
   deployment, and performance characterization of the multi-domain data
   plane, along with its integration into the SLICES-Madrid site. This
   article offers insights into the design, implementation, and
   implications of a multi-domain deterministic data plane, providing
   valuable contributions to the research community and laying the
   ground-work for future community experimentation in the field of
   deterministic networking.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the Circular Economy has gained significant traction,
   driven by increased awareness among governments, companies, and
   consumers about the imperative to optimize resource consumption. The
   textile industry, acknowledged as one of the most resource-intensive
   sectors, is now actively adopting circular practices to supersede
   traditional linear strategies. These circular practices may cover all
   the aspects of the product lifecycle from the design and production
   usage to the end of life, aiming to value as much as possible the
   resources used. In parallel, the fourth industrial revolution reshapes
   manufacturing companies by integrating vital enabling technologies on
   the shop floor, enhancing operational efficiency alongside existing
   information systems. Nevertheless, exploring how these technologies may
   facilitate the circular transition of the textile industry has been
   performed in a scattered manner by some authors, and a comprehensive
   picture covering the entire product lifecycle opportunities still needs
   to be included. To address this gap, the authors analyzed 20 academic
   articles published till November 2023, retrieved from the Scopus
   database. The findings from the literature provided the use of digital
   technologies to implement the transition of a circular economy within
   the textile industry. The framework is developed to integrate existing
   studies, assisting textile industries in leveraging digital
   transformation for a circular transition across product lifecycle
   management. Finally, this study highlights future research directions
   that could offer valuable insights to practitioners and researchers.},

	abstract = {Objective
   Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease, requiring frequent
   patient-provider interaction and self-monitoring. We developed a novel
   mobile health smartphone app with a voice-enabled feature to help
   patients virtually track disease activity and ask general questions
   about RA.
   Methods
   With a user-centered design (UCD) approach, we developed a voice-enabled
   app (VEA) which was then tested in two focus groups of patients (n=8)
   and one with providers (n=4). Voice enablement and a question and answer
   (Q\&A) library function were previously requested by patients. Based on
   focus group feedback, the VEA was refined and tested with 26 patients
   for 56 days. The VEA asked patients to fill in daily patient-reported
   outcomes (PROs) and complete the trial with a satisfaction survey.
   Results
   Of the 26 patients in the VEA trial, 77\% were female and 50\% were aged
   55 and older. Adherence to daily PROs during the 56-day trial was 66\%,
   with <1\% of PROs completed using the voice-enabled feature. PROMIS
   short forms and RADAI-5 PROs remained stable. Of the 22 satisfaction
   survey respondents, 86\% were satisfied with their overall experience
   with the app and 18.5\% were satisfied with voice enablement. The voice
   assistant had an 86\% success rate at understanding and answering
   interactions regarding surveys and a 44\% success rate regarding Q\&A
   interactions.
   Conclusion
   We developed a novel VEA through a UCD framework and conducted pilot
   testing. Adherence was moderate and RADAI-5 and PROMIS measures were
   stable. Based on satisfaction results, PROs may not be the best use of
   voice enablement technology.},

@article{WOS:001194580300058,
	abstract = {Digital technologies, such as big data, the Internet, and artificial
   intelligence, are rapidly advancing. Photovoltaic building materials
   enterprises (PBMEs) have been leveraging digital transformation to
   enhance their technological innovation capabilities and gain a
   competitive edge. In the global context of transitioning towards a
   low-carbon economy, the deep integration of digital technology offers a
   new solution for the green transformation of PBMEs. The synergy between
   green traction digitalization and digitalization enables green
   practices, making collaborative integration crucial for the far-reaching
   development of PBMEs. Within the framework of China's ``double
   carbon{''} policy, domestic PBMEs are experiencing exponential growth,
   where digital green innovation (DGI) has become their primary objective.
   In this DGI context, selecting the right partners is the first step that
   significantly impacts the efficiency and effectiveness of DGI
   implementation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assist PBMEs
   in selecting high-quality partners, promoting the DGI process, enhancing
   technological innovation capabilities, and gaining a competitive
   advantage. To achieve this, the paper proposes constructing a
   theoretical framework for evaluating the DGI cooperation ability of
   PBMEs using the theory of ecological reciprocity. Based on this
   framework, an evaluation index system is established to assess the DGI
   cooperation ability of potential partners The interval intuitionistic
   fuzzy evaluation method, combined with a double combination weighting
   approach, is employed to evaluate the DGI ability of selected partners.
   Furthermore, by applying field theory, a dynamic selection model for
   strategic alliance partners is developed to aid PBMEs in selecting
   high-quality partners for DGI and facilitating the DGI process. The
   research findings indicate that: i) The evaluation standard framework
   for DGI cooperation ability of PBMEs encompasses ``symbiosis,{''}
   ``mutualism,{''} and ``regeneration,{''} along with the crucial
   environmental element of mutual trust. ii) The evaluation method based
   on double combination weighting effectively assesses the comprehensive
   DGI capabilities of selected PBME partners. The application of field
   theory enables scientific and effective dynamic partner selection for
   PBMEs through resource complementarity. iii) The proposed framework and
   partner selection model can be employed in real partner selection
   scenarios for PBMEs, allowing them to choose high-quality partners,
   enhance their DGI capabilities, and attain practical selection outcomes.
   This paper presents novel partner selection model that integrates
   decision rules and resource complementarity, enabling PBMEs to
   efficiently select DGI partners from a pool of potential candidates and
   improve their innovation efficiency. The utilization of the double
   combination weighting method and field theory in the partner selection
   paradigm of D extends the theoretical foundation, while the
   establishment of the DGI capability evaluation index system for PBME
   partners contributes to empirical applications.},

	abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to assess the readiness of retail workers to use
   blockchain technology (BCT) to improve supply chain performance. The
   assessment was made via a quantitative approach taken using a
   theoretical framework based on Keller's motivation model and
   self-determination theory in the BCT
   context.Design/methodology/approachThe authors collected data from 567
   retail workers from an emerging country through a structured survey
   questionnaire. The authors tested the hypotheses of the proposed model
   using Warp PLS 7.0 and controlled firm age, industry type and
   technological intensity.FindingsOur findings may help firms in making
   the process of digital transformation inclusive. The authors found that
   supplier-based attention and motivation through BCT lead to supply chain
   performance, and that supplier-based satisfaction and trust achieved
   through BCT positively impact supply chain performance. Further,
   supplier-based relevance on raw material selection with the higher trust
   and motivation levels achieved through BCT was found to have a positive
   impact on supply chain performance.Research limitations/implicationsIT
   supply chain applications are referred to as ``lean{''} rather than
   ``rich{''} because they still rely mainly on written and numerical means
   to present data. When the environment is less ambiguous, then less rich
   media can be used to facilitate communication. IT supply chain
   applications allow suppliers to spend time building relationships with
   other suppliers instead of focusing on administrative tasks, thus
   enhancing such relationships.Originality/valueThis study can be
   considered the first to assess retailer readiness to use BCT to improve
   supply chain performance through the theoretical lens of Keller's
   motivation model and self-determination theory.},

	abstract = {Digital supply chain (SC) transformation has emerged as a way to improve
   information sharing, better manage demand, and reduce costs in supply
   chain management. However, the majority of firms are unable to transform
   their supply chains into digital models. Thus, this study aims to
   identify the key drivers of digital SC transformation and provide
   empirical evidence on the extent to which firms' knowledge creation
   capabilities could impact firms' level of digital supply chain
   transformation. Based on a knowledge-based view, this study proposes
   that firms' knowledge creation capabilities - which consist of the
   capacity to absorb external knowledge and the intent to learn with
   partners within the SC - are crucial to the successful knowledge
   transfer required to digitially transform, particularly under the
   effects of COVID-19 supply chain disruption risks. Survey data collected
   from 923 Vietnamese firms participating in cross-border trades were
   analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling
   (PLS-SEM). This study finds that firms' absorptive capacity and learning
   intent are critical drivers of their digital supply chain
   transformation. Moreover, the high uncertainties in external
   environments are found to substantially accelerate the digital
   transformation processes and influence the effectiveness of firms'
   knowledge creation capabilities in digital SC transformation.
   Significantly, firms are more inclined toward external knowledge sources
   to cope with disruption risks in the supply chain. This study
   contributes a novel approach to better understanding the role of
   knowledge creation capabilities in responding to supply chain disruption
   risks and fills a gap in research on drivers of successful digital SC
   transformation.},

	abstract = {Objectives: While many pilot projects have provided proof-of-concept
   information on CDSS efficacy, they encompass disparate systems unable to
   fully realise digital transformation. A lack of system-wide guidance on
   CDSS integration limits the efficacy of even technically well-positioned
   systems. The objective of this study was to identify challenges and
   opportunities relating to CDSS implementation in Australia.
   Methods: Opting for a qualitative approach, we purposefully sampled at
   national and state levels policymakers involved in CDSS implementation
   in Australia. We completed 11 semi-structured interviews from March to
   June 2020. The data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.
   Results: The Australian digital health landscape for CDSS implementation
   appears to be fragmented, characterised by a lack of integration between
   clinical and technological elements. This fragmentation is exacerbated
   by the lack of a shared understanding and collaboration between key
   stakeholders, increasing the risk of conflicting interests. CDSS are
   usually designed for a particular clinical workflow, and a lack of
   interoperability reduces the information flow between systems. Most
   efforts to achieve data standardisation are limited to organisational or
   state-level programs, thus increasing the risk of uncoordinated care
   across organisations. Considering different stakeholder perspectives on
   the value of CDSS could help to foster sustainable partnerships between
   governments, organisations, and consumers.
   Conclusion: Our findings emphasise the importance of three things, each
   underpinned by stakeholder engagement: developing a clear and shared
   vision for innovation, building clinicians' skills and organisational
   capacity for change, and establishing a national consensus on data
   standards for interoperable CDSS.},

	abstract = {Technological advancements and the COVID-19 pandemic have catapulted
   process virtualization across many industries, including healthcare,
   where telehealth has enabled significant digital transformation of care
   delivery. Although telehealth has been proposed as a potential solution
   to improve access to care and restrain runaway healthcare costs, it can
   increase spending if telehealth use leads to new types of resource
   utilization. Drawing on the lens of process virtualization theory, we
   study the impact of telehealth on healthcare utilization by examining
   visit-level patient data of telehealth use in facilitating e-visits with
   healthcare providers. On average, a telehealth visit reduces the number
   of future outpatient visits by 13.6\% (or 0.15 visits), equal to a
   reduction of \$239 in total cost within 30 days after the visit. Our
   results suggest that the benefits of telehealth use are observed
   primarily among diseases with high virtualization potential.
   Specifically, patients with mental health, skin, metabolic, and
   musculoskeletal diseases exhibit a significant reduction of 0.21
   outpatient visits per quarter (an equivalent cost reduction of \$179)
   when they are treated via telehealth, suggesting a substitution effect
   with respect to traditional clinic visits. Our research identifies the
   boundary conditions that determine the nuanced impact of telehealth on
   care utilization and shows that its effectiveness depends on the process
   virtualization potential of different diseases. Our findings have
   several practical and theoretical implications for fostering telehealth
   use in a value-based healthcare environment, especially for diseases
   with high virtualization potential where telehealth use should be
   promoted to bend the cost curve.},

   engagement and business performance, particularly in tourism. This study
   evaluates the e-commerce adoption of Kazakhstan's tourism websites using
   an innovative Integrated Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (IMCDA)
   methodology. Traditional evaluation methods overlook the interplay
   between website functionality, user experience, and strategic
   objectives. To address this gap, the IMCDA framework integrates
   qualitative and quantitative approaches by combining advanced
   Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques, including SPOTIS,
   ESP-COMET, RANCOM, and SITW, with content analysis and logistic
   regression. The study assessed 77 tourism websites, categorized into
   Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), Official Tourism Websites (OTWs), and
   Attraction Websites (AWs), based on 34 e-commerce features grouped into
   dimensions such as product information, functionality, reservations,
   payment systems, and customer relationship management (CRM). The
   findings reveal that OTAs significantly outperform OTWs and AWs in most
   dimensions, especially in online booking and CRM functionalities. At the
   same time, AWs lag in key e-commerce features like reservations and
   payment systems. This research highlights critical gaps in Kazakhstan's
   tourism e-commerce ecosystem. It provides actionable recommendations,
   including enhancing CRM tools, integrating advanced booking systems, and
   leveraging collaborations with local financial technology providers like
   Kaspi Pay. The IMCDA framework offers a robust, adaptable evaluation
   model with practical implications for digital transformation and
   competitiveness in the tourism industry. This study contributes to
   advancing digital maturity in Kazakhstan's tourism sector by addressing
   these gaps. It sets the foundation for future research to explore

   delivered through multiple digital channels like smart products, cloud
   systems, and workers enhanced by virtually augmented systems. Since
   these channels are data-intensive dependent, they usually require data
   sources from the company's service ecosystem. Prior studies have shown
   how to build network capabilities for Smart PSS, but little is known
   about the extensive integration of data in such service ecosystems. We
   aim to understand how multichannel digital services can be supported by
   the integration of real-time data from service ecosystems to provide
   Smart PSS business models. Using the organizational
   information-processing theory, we consider the integration of data from
   three ecosystem actors (other business units, suppliers, and customers)
   and analyze how such data sources can support the use of these digital
   technologies in three types of Smart PSS business models. We examine
   these relationships through regression analyses based on a survey of 92
   manufacturers, providing a typology of different Smart PSS business
   models in the ecosystem. Our study enlightens how data flows through the
   ecosystem actors to support Smart PSS business models. Practitioners and
   scholars can learn how to treat Smart PSS according to the specific
   business models to be implemented and how to combine digital
   technologies with data integration channels in the service ecosystem.
   Moreover, we show how this combination of digital transformation and
   Smart PSS help expand the organizational information-processing theory
   in the innovation ecosystems' domain, also providing a new vein of

	abstract = {Materials are the fundament of the physical world, whereas information
   and its exchange are the centerpieces of the digital world. Their
   fruitful synergy offers countless opportunities for realizing desired
   digital transformation processes in the physical world of materials.
   Yet, to date, a perfect connection between these worlds is missing. From
   the perspective, this can be achieved by overcoming the paradigm of
   considering materials as passive objects and turning them into
   perceptual, information-providing matter. This matter is capable of
   communicating associated digitally stored information, for example, its
   origin, fate, and material type as well as its intactness on demand.
   Herein, the concept of realizing perceptual, information-providing
   matter by integrating customizable (sub-)micrometer-sized communicating
   supraparticles (CSPs) is presented. They are assembled from individual
   nanoparticulate and/or (macro)molecular building blocks with spectrally
   differentiable signals that are either robust or stimuli-susceptible.
   Their combination yields functional signal characteristics that provide
   an identification signature and one or multiple stimuli-recorder
   features. This enables CSPs to communicate associated digital
   information on the tagged material and its encountered stimuli histories
   upon signal readout anywhere across its life cycle. Ultimately, CSPs
   link the materials and digital worlds with numerous use cases thereof,
   in particular fostering the transition into an age of sustainability.
   The emerging concept of communicating supraparticles (CSPs), i.e.,
   (sub-)micrometer-sized information providing additives, is presented.
   Their functional signal characteristics comprise an identification
   signature and stimuli-recorder features. Integration of customized CSPs
   into materials turns them from passive objects into perceptual,
   information-providing matter. Upon interrogation of CSPs, digitally
   associated information on the hosting material and its intactness is
   obtained on demand.image},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of new computing paradigms such as Cloud Computing and
   Big Data has unleashed great opportunities for companies to shift their
   business model towards a fully digital strategy. A major obstacle in
   this matter is the requirement of highly specialized ICT infrastructures
   that are expensive and difficult to manage. It is at this point that the
   IaaS (infrastructure as a service) model offers an efficient and
   cost-affordable solution to supply companies with their required
   computing resources. In the Big Data context, it is often a hard task to
   design an optimal IaaS solution that meets user requirements. In this
   context, we propose a methodology to optimize the definition of IaaS
   cloud models for hosting Big Data platforms, following a threefold
   criterion: cost, reliability, and computing capacity. Specifically, the
   proposed methodology hinges on evolutionary heuristics in order to find
   IaaS configurations in the cloud that optimally balance such objectives.
   We also define measures to quantify the aforementioned metrics over a
   Big Data platform hosted within an IaaS cloud model. The proposed method
   is validated by using real information from three IaaS providers and
   three Big Data platforms. The obtained results provide an insightful
   input for system managers when initially designing cloud infrastructures
   for Big Data applications.},

	abstract = {Purpose While manufacturing digitalization is currently considered an
   important enabler of competitive advantage, its applicability across the
   industrial spectrum is unclear. This paper aims to investigate the
   relationship between the use of digital technologies and different
   production environments and company sizes. The focus is on three aspects
   of digitalization: shop floor digitalization, technologies for vertical
   and horizontal integration and organizational IT competence.
   Design/methodology/approach This study is based on data gathered from a
   survey questionnaire sent to 212 Norwegian manufacturing companies. To
   test the formulated hypotheses, the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   method was used. Findings This study confirmed that large enterprises
   (LEs) have a significantly higher level of shop floor digitalization and
   organizational IT competence than small and medium-sized enterprises
   (SMEs). Regarding the difference between production environments, no
   statistically significant difference in the implementation level of the
   investigated digitalization aspects could be found. Originality/value To
   the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies to
   investigate differences in the adoption of digital technologies between
   different groups of production environments. This study also provides
   updated findings related to the relationship between digitalization and
   company size. The findings presented in this paper provide important
   insights into directing future research efforts to assist environments
   that are currently lagging behind in their digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Waste management is a challenge for modern cities as it impacts on
   environmental sustainability and on the level of quality perceived by
   citizens. In the last few years, several progresses have been made in
   this direction with the introduction in the city of door-to-door
   separate waste collection. A key element for the success of such actions
   is to achieve excellent cooperation from citizens. The Digital
   Transformation process in this sector will require time other than a
   careful management of the data associated with the waste collection
   processes. At this regard, the progress of hardware and software
   technologies enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) will contribute
   significantly to accelerate the whole process. Among these innovative
   solutions, the use of RFID tags with augmented capabilities and
   cloud-based software architectures capable of properly managing
   collected data will be crucial to obtain an intelligent and efficient
   waste management system. In this paper, an innovative system capable of
   capturing and processing data relating to the door-to-door separate
   waste collection in the context of future smart cities is presented. In
   particular, the system includes an innovative RFID sensor-tag equipped
   with low-cost weight sensors and a Cloud software system capable of
   managing the collected data and satisfying the various stakeholders'
   expectations. First results on both functional and performance
   validation of the overall system are shown.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of industry 4.0, several elements of the supply chain
   are transforming through the adoption of smart technologies such as
   blockchain, the internet of things and cyber-physical systems. Logistics
   is considered one of the important elements of supply chain management
   and its digital transformation is crucial to the success of industry
   4.0. In this circumstance, the existing logistics system needs to be
   upgraded with industry 4.0 technologies and emerge as logistics 4.0.
   However, the adoption/transformation of logistics 4.0 is dependent on
   several determinants that need to be explored. Therefore, this study has
   the prime objective of investigating the determinants of logistics 4.0
   adoption in the context of a developing country, specifically, India.
   Initially, ten determinants of logistics 4.0 are established after a
   survey of the relevant literature and the input of industry experts.
   Further, a four-level structural model is developed among these
   determinants using the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach.
   In addition, a fuzzy Matrix of Cross-Impact Multiplications Applied to
   Classification (MICMAC) analysis is also conducted for the
   categorization of these determinants as per their driving and dependence
   power. The findings show that top management supports, information
   technology infrastructure and financial investment are the most
   significant determinants towards logistics 4.0 adoption. This study
   facilitates the supply chain partners to focus on these high-level
   determinants for the effective adoption of logistics 4.0. Moreover, the
   findings lead to a more in-depth insight into the determinants that
   influence logistics 4.0 and their significance in logistics 4.0 adoption
   in emerging economies.},

	abstract = {Purpose The new digital era brings several opportunities and challenges
   that accelerate the need to implement digital solutions in
   organisations. This speed of change creates many questions, but
   unfortunately, references cases to answer them or general guidelines to
   succeed are still rare. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to
   present four cases that illustrate the procedure followed by companies
   to introduce digital elements in their operations (automotive industry
   supplier, toy industry, catering company and circuit trainings company).
   Each case offers inspiration and knowledge about the procedure to
   introduce digital elements and facilitates the proposal of a general
   procedure that aims to become guidance for practitioners.
   Design/methodology/approach The research implements comparative analysis
   in a multi-case design. It sensitises the concept of ``digitalisation
   path{''} as a research instrument. Projects documentation and informal
   conversational interviews allow the researchers to describe each
   organisation and their digitalisation path. The interviewees review,
   enhance and approve the cases. Furthermore, the research compares the
   paths and summarises the findings into a digitalisation path model that
   explains the digitalisation of these organisations and it serves as a
   guide for other organisations. Findings The digitalisation paths
   evidence the necessity of business process management to develop
   digitalisation. Technology is not the goal, but the instrument and
   process excellence is the driver to introduce new technologies in the
   operations. Furthermore, the four organisations share a similar pattern
   and activities within their digitalisation paths. Research
   limitations/implications - The multi-case methodology lacks
   generalisation, but it provides detail over the digitalisation paths.
   Practical implications - The paper presents a guideline for
   practitioners to introduce digital elements in the organisation.
   Originality/value The paper presents a practical perspective to
   introduce digitalisation in organisations, which is currently rare in
   literature.},

	abstract = {Meeting the future workforce demands of the construction industry is
   defined as one of the main paths for sustainable engineering education.
   Quantity surveyors play a crucial role in driving the digital
   transformation of the construction industry. There is a pressing need to
   cultivate a significant number of engineering graduates who meet market
   demands to bolster the workforce of quantity surveyors for accomplishing
   this core mission. In this context, this study examined the main gaps
   existing between engineering graduates and quantity surveyors in terms
   of personal competencies needed to successfully value projects. Through
   the participation of 262 individuals (165 quantity surveyors and 97
   engineering graduates), using a literature review, personal interviews,
   and a questionnaire survey, it was possible to assess five competencies
   (sustainable competency, budget competency, site management competency,
   engineering ethics, and settlement competency), and determine
   significant differences between both groups. All personal competencies'
   mean scores are higher for quantity surveyors than for engineering
   graduates. Four competencies are found to differ significantly between
   quantity surveyors and engineering graduates: sustainable competency,
   budget competency, site management competency, and settlement
   competency. As the conclusion derived from this study, it is recommended
   to introduce market-oriented mechanisms and establish a dynamic
   engineering talent model driven by market demand through collaborative
   development involving school-enterprise partnerships and the integration
   of expertise and creativity, aiming to foster the development of social
   practice competency. Particular emphasis should be placed on
   strengthening budget competency, site management competency, and
   settlement competency. The findings guide the education, training, and
   practice of quantity surveying to deal with emerging challenges in the
   dynamic market demand in China and beyond.},

	abstract = {Omnichannel retailing enables retailers to address challenges from
   digital transformation and the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding what
   motivates customers to stick with an omnichannel retailer and make
   repeat purchases is critical. While existing research has primarily
   focused on retailer-centric perspectives and seamless customer
   experiences, customer-centric factors-such as omnichannel synergy,
   defined as the added value created by integrating multiple channels and
   resources-remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap by
   integrating the dedication-constraint (DC) model with key contextual
   factors, including omnichannel synergy and transaction costs, to examine
   customer post-adoption decisions, specifically omnichannel stickiness
   and repurchase intention. The DC model elucidates how dedication
   mechanisms (desire for long-term relationships, reflected in omnichannel
   synergy and customer-brand engagement {[}CBE]) and constraint mechanisms
   (past investments and benefits, reflected in seamless experience {[}SE],
   transaction costs, and calculative attachment) influence customer
   behavior. Based on a quantitative survey of 802 omnichannel users,
   supplemented by in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, the
   findings reveal that (1) dedication and constraint mechanisms explain
   74\% of the variance in customer stickiness and 69\% in repurchase
   intention, (2) omnichannel synergy accounts for 61\% of CBE variance,
   and (3) SE and transaction cost-savings explain 41\% of calculative
   attachment. This study shifts the focus of omnichannel research from
   traditional retailer-centered metrics to customer-centered perspectives,
   offering a cross-disciplinary model that underscores the pivotal role of
   omnichannel synergy in shaping post-adoption behaviors. Retailers are
   advised to invest in the four pillars of omnichannel synergy-horizontal,
   vertical, strategic, and financial-to strengthen customer retention and
   drive repeat purchases through integrated channels, strategic
   partnerships, and cost efficiencies.},

	abstract = {Background: Digital health tools comprise a wide range of technologies
   to support health processes. The potential of these technologies to
   effectively support health care transformation is widely accepted.
   However, wide scale implementation is uneven among countries and
   regions. Identification of common factors facilitating and hampering the
   implementation process may be useful for future policy recommendations.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the implementation of
   digital health tools to support health care and social care services, as
   well as to facilitate the longitudinal assessment of these services, in
   17 selected integrated chronic care (ICC) programs from 8 European
   countries.
   Methods: A program analysis based on thick descriptions-including
   document examinations and semistructured interviews with relevant
   stakeholders-of ICC programs in Austria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, the
   Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom was performed. A
   total of 233 stakeholders (ie, professionals, providers, patients,
   carers, and policymakers) were interviewed from November 2014 to
   September 2016. The overarching analysis focused on the use of digital
   health tools and program assessment strategies.
   Results: Supporting digital health tools are implemented in all
   countries, but different levels of maturity were observed among the
   programs. Only few ICC programs have well-established strategies for a
   comprehensive longitudinal assessment. There is a strong relationship
   between maturity of digital health and proper evaluation strategies of
   integrated care.
   Conclusions: Notwithstanding the heterogeneity of the results across
   countries, most programs aim to evolve toward a digital transformation
   of integrated care, including implementation of comprehensive assessment
   strategies. It is widely accepted that the evolution of digital health
   tools alongside clear policies toward their adoption will facilitate
   regional uptake and scale-up of services with embedded digital health
   tools.},

	abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to examine and understand the impact of reverse
   logistics adoption on firms' digitalization and collaboration
   activities. Specifically, leveraging the knowledge-based view, this
   study examines how adopting sustainable logistic practices (reverse
   logistics) prepares firms to embrace digitalization and encourages them
   to collaborate with other organizations.Design/methodology/approachThe
   study used longitudinal survey data from two waves (2017 and 2019) from
   the Mannheim Centre for European Economic Research. The authors used the
   negative binomial regression analyses to test the impact of reverse
   logistics adoption on the digitalization and inter-organizational
   collaboration dependent count variables.FindingsThe study's findings
   highlight the usefulness of reverse logistics in enabling digitalization
   and inter-organizational collaboration. The results show that the firms
   investing in sustainable supply chains will be better positioned to
   nurture digitalization and inter-organizational collaboration.Practical
   implicationsFor resource-bound managers, this study provides an
   important insight into prioritizing activities by highlighting how
   reverse logistics can facilitate digitalization and collaboration. The
   study demonstrates that the knowledge generated by reverse logistics
   adoption can be an essential pillar and enabler toward achieving firms'
   digitalization and collaboration goals.Originality/valueThe study is
   among the first to examine the effect of reverse logistics adoption on
   firm activities that are not strictly associated with the circular
   economy (digitalization and collaboration). Utilizing the
   knowledge-based view, this study reports on the additional benefits of
   reverse logistics implementation previously not discussed in the
   literature.},

	abstract = {PurposeThe Internet of Things (IoT) platform empowers the digital
   transformation of the manufacturing industry by providing information
   technology services. Simultaneously, it enters the market by offering
   smart products to consumers. In light of different service fee
   scenarios, this article explores the optimal decision-making for the
   platform. It investigates the pricing models and entry decisions of IoT
   platforms.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, we have formulated a
   game-theoretic model to scrutinize the influence of the IoT platform
   ventured into the smart device market on the pre-existing suppliers
   operating under subscription-based and usage-based pricing
   agreements.FindingsOur outcome shows that introducing an IoT platform's
   smart device has a differential effect on manufacturers depending on
   their contract type. Notably, our research indicates that introducing
   the platform's own smart device within the subscription-based model does
   not negatively impact the profitability of incumbent manufacturers, so
   long as there is a noticeable discrepancy in the quality of the smart
   devices. However, our findings within the usage-based model demonstrate
   that despite the variance in smart device quality differentiation, the
   platform's resolution to launch their device and impose their pricing
   agreements adversely affects established manufacturers. Additionally, we
   obtain valuable Intel regarding the platform's entry strategies and
   contractual inclinations. We demonstrate that the platform is
   incentivized to present its smart device when reasonable entry costs
   remain. Furthermore, the platform prefers subscription-based contracts
   when the subscription fee is relatively high in non-platform entry and
   entry cases.Originality/valueThese findings hold significant practical
   implications for firms operating in an IoT-based supply chain.},

	abstract = {Research on sustainable manufacturing is currently gaining momentum and
   becoming a dynamically developing field that considers green innovations
   (GI). However, rapid dynamics cause the entire field to fragment into
   smaller topics with different research interests, impacts, and
   development dynamics over time. This study aims to create a
   comprehensive scientific map of GI in manufacturing by systematically
   processing 9376 documents retrieved from the Scopus database. The
   results show that this research domain gained significant momentum in
   2019, with most studies published in the engineering and business
   subject area. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used to identify 94 unique
   topics from all abstracts. We classified the topics into five
   territories regarding their level of systematization: uncharted (26
   topics), discovering (23), expanding (15), well -recognized (19), and
   marginal (11). The least uncharted topics in the field of GI in
   manufacturing that have potential for systematization are Resource
   -based Performance Modeling, Sustainabilityoriented Performance, and
   Supplier Decision Criteria and Fuzzy Logic. The most significant topics
   related to GI in manufacturing currently include Smart Technologies and
   Industry 4.0, Green Supply Chain, Carbon Emission Reduction, and Digital
   Transformation, with the last two having the most dynamic development.
   The results offer objective information for a wider scientific
   discussion regarding the direction of research in green manufacturing
   concept and point to uncharted areas that may represent future
   directions for the development of this concept. (c) 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Understanding the digital jump of bank customers is key to design
   strategies to bring on board and keep online users, as well as to
   explain the increasing competition from new providers of financial
   services (such as BigTech and FinTech). This paper employs a machine
   learning approach to examine the digitalization process of bank
   customers using a comprehensive consumer finance survey. By employing a
   set of algorithms (random forests, conditional inference trees and
   causal forests) this paper identities the features predicting bank
   customers' digitalization process, illustrates the sequence of
   consumers' decision-making actions and explores the existence of causal
   relationships in the digitalization process. Random forests are found to
   provide the highest performance-they accurately predict 88.41\% of bank
   customers' online banking adoption and usage decisions. We find that the
   adoption of digital banking services begins with information-based
   services (e.g., checking account balance), conditional on the awareness
   of the range of online services by customers, and then is followed by
   transactional services (e.g., online/mobile money transfer). The
   diversification of the use of online channels is explained by the
   consciousness about the range of services available and the safety
   perception. A certain degree of complementarity between bank and
   non-bank digital channels is also found. The treatment effect
   estimations of the causal forest algorithms confirm causality of the
   identified explanatory factors. These results suggest that banks should
   address the digital transformation of their customers by segmenting them
   according to their revealed preferences and offering them personalized
   digital services. Additionally, policymakers should promote financial
   digitalization, designing policies oriented towards making consumers
   aware of the range of online services available.},

   economic boom and Information Technology (IT) has been emerging as a
   tool to enable the competitiveness of companies. The last government
   (2014-2018) took different actions to explain how the use of data
   science and open data improve the business activity. The question to
   identify if there is a relationship between IT capacities, the
   organizational structure and the performance of the companies remains
   unresolved and is certainly an urgent issue for new government of Ivan
   Duque.
   Purpose: Our study analyses the relationship between data structure and
   business performance measured through the efficiency of customer
   experience and provider operations processes.
   Methodology: our methodology is novel compared to previous researches
   which develop linear regression. It is based on the use of a fuzzy-set
   qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA).
   Originality/value: our method allows to reveal multiple and
   complementary paths to achieve possible correlations between data and
   business performance.
   Findings: Our results show that data consistency, data usage and data
   protection are the three more frequent conditions to a better customer
   experience and provider operations efficiency. Surprisingly, data-driven
   profile is a necessary but not sufficient condition.
   Practical implications: our conclusions allow practitioners to uncover
   the strength of the data to orientate their digital strategy. Our
   recommendations could be used for the new governmental program of
   digital revival for Small and Medium Enterprises.},

	abstract = {In the context of ``carbon neutral{''}, distributed energy, including
   photovoltaic power generation and energy storage systems, is developing
   rapidly. Meanwhile, the new generation of information technology, such
   as ``Cloud computing, Big data, the Internet of things, Mobile Internet,
   AI, Blockchain{''}, is driving the digital transformation of the energy
   industry. Under digital drive, how the agents in the
   photovoltaic-storage-use value chain collaborate and create value
   intelligently is a question worthy of deep consideration. Firstly, the
   value creation mechanism and collaborative process of the digital-driven
   photovoltaic-storage-use value chain are analyzed from a value
   intelligence creation perspective. Secondly, the tripartite evolutionary
   game model of photovoltaic power generator, energy storage provider and
   user is established. Finally, the influencing factors of digital- driven
   photovoltaic-storage-use value chain collaboration are explored through
   a numerical simulation, and management suggestions are put forward. The
   study finds the following: (1) The behavior choice of each agent in the
   value chain will affect the decision of other agents. In particular, the
   photovoltaic power generator has a great influence on the cooperative
   willingness of other agents. To promote value chain collaboration, the
   guiding role of the photovoltaic power generator should be fully
   realized. (2) Agents on the value chain can use a variety of digital
   technologies to improve enabling benefits, which is conducive to
   promoting value chain collaboration. (3) The driving costs and potential
   risks are obstacles for value chain collaboration. Cost reduction and
   risk prevention are effective ways to improve the willingness of
   collaboration. (4) Reasonable incentive compensation mechanisms and
   information asymmetry punishment measures are the keys to enhancing
   collective willingness. This research provides theoretical support for
   photovoltaic-storage-use value chain collaboration from a value
   intelligence creation perspective.},

	abstract = {Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) have undergone tremendous
   development in the recent past. With the sharp increase in documentation
   requirements for agricultural businesses, the potential of FMIS to
   become widely used comprehensive management tools is high but not yet
   fully exploited in practice. Consequently, there is a need to improve
   and adjust these systems. However, there is little research about how to
   optimize FMIS in order to meet the needs of the users. To answer this
   question, a deeper understanding of how users differ from other groups
   regarding their intensity of use and their perceptions of FMIS is needed
   but has hardly been explored so far. By means of a standardized online
   questionnaire in the summer of 2019, the skills and attitudes of 280
   German farmers regarding the use of FMIS were surveyed. By means of a
   cluster analysis, different user segments were analyzed to gain deeper
   insights into which characteristics FMIS users and nonusers have. Four
   clusters were identified including two non-user groups and two user
   groups with varying potential for FMIS providers and marketers. The
   results show that the lack of persuasiveness of the existing systems by
   not (yet) offering solutions to farmers' problems and needs is a major
   barrier. One main driver for the use of FMIS is to manage the increasing
   political and social requirements with the help of a professional
   documentation of farm activities. On the one hand, the results accompany
   the ongoing digital transformation in agribusiness and contribute on the
   other hand to the digitization process on farms by increasing new
   knowledge about farmers' requirements regarding FMIS. The results also
   provide relevant insights for software development companies to adjust
   their products according to the farmers' needs.},

	abstract = {Purpose All firms' business models are based on their interdependencies
   with other parties in their ecosystems. The Internet of Things (IoT) is
   beginning to fundamentally disrupt the agri-food industry, forcing the
   ecosystem to change. When an ecosystem is transforming, the
   interdependencies among its actors can create friction. Technology
   providers and core actors should consider these interdependencies as
   they update their strategies for value creation and capture. The purpose
   of the present research is to consider what it might take for agri-food
   firms to capitalize on these interdependencies by moving from
   traditional business models to business models based on collaboration
   and open innovation. Design/methodology/approach The present paper draws
   on data from four online focus groups that we created to discuss how to
   co-create the business models agri-food firms need in a constantly
   changing environment. The paper presents an application of
   phenomenon-driven research (PDR), an engaged methodology. The study
   method enables novel pathways to develop and implement innovative
   solutions. This study draws on the interaction of theory and practice
   and involves multiple stakeholders with varying roles in the agri-food
   ecosystem. Findings The authors found that any open innovation setup in
   agri-food needs to constantly reconfigure itself to balance the needs of
   farmers and the needs of the market. This interplay can only support the
   IoT-enabled ecosystem if continuous interaction and negotiation occur
   among various stakeholders of the food system. When the farmers' needs
   and the market's needs are aligned, the space for developing a
   collaborative and open business model is prepared. Originality/value The
   insights gained from this study inspire action and commitment to common
   goals when developing collaboration-based business models (CBMs). The
   paper offers insights for players in the agri-food industry who are
   considering CBMs in the course of digital transformation.},

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of digitalization on the participation of
   small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in export and import
   activities. Using data on Spanish manufacturing SMEs from 2001 to 2014,
   we construct a multidimensional firm-level index of digitalization. We
   then estimate a set of dynamic models analyzing the direct and indirect
   (via total factor productivity) effects of digitalization on firms'
   export and import strategies. We find evidence that firms'
   digitalization positively influences the probability of exporting and
   importing, both directly and through productivity. We find that
   productivity has a stronger impact on SMEs' trade behavior than the
   direct channel of digitalization. A one standard deviation increase in
   the digitalization index increases the probability of exporting and
   importing by 1.5 and 0.8 percentage points, respectively, while the same
   increase in the logarithm of productivity has a three times greater
   effect for exporting and nine times greater for importing.
   Plain English SummaryDigitalization facilitates the access of SMEs to
   international markets. In this study, we analyze how the use of digital
   technologies affects Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
   in their ability to access foreign markets. We find that digitization
   can help SMEs to export and import, both directly (by facilitating
   access to a larger market of customers and suppliers) and by improving
   their productivity. Interestingly, we also find that productivity has a
   greater impact on trade decisions than the direct channel of
   digitalization. It should be noted that not all digital technologies
   have the same effect on trade participation, and that automation
   technologies only influence trade through the productivity channel.
   Based on our findings, policymakers interested in helping SMEs export
   and integrate into global markets should support their digital
   transformation.},

	abstract = {PurposeThe cold supply chain industry is still emerging and digital
   transformation is in the nascent stage in this industry. This paper
   argues that there are various barriers to implementing blockchain
   technology in the cold supply chain and aims to develop and validate a
   model for overcoming key barriers to implementing blockchain technology
   in the cold supply chain.Design/methodology/approachThe adoption of
   blockchain technology was proposed through interpretive structural
   modeling (ISM) and further it is validated using structural equation
   modeling (SEM).FindingsIn this study, ten key barriers to implementing
   blockchain technology in the cold supply chain were identified, modelled
   and analysed. Poor leadership style of top management was found to be
   the most important barriers to implementing blockchain technology in the
   cold supply chain. The results of SEM indicate that all the paths are
   supported. The findings showcase the barriers responsible for the lack
   of blockchain technology infrastructure that ultimately impacts the cold
   supply chains.Practical implicationsThis study highlights the fact that
   the fate of blockchain technology infrastructure development depends on
   the leadership style of top management. Demonstrating good leadership
   style by top management can help overcome the barriers. A good leader
   pulls the entire team instead of pushing the team. A good leader can
   guide the entire team to improve IT governance, financial investment,
   digital footprint, digital readiness, skills and collaboration with
   service providers to implement blockchain technology. Not only that, a
   good leader provides mental strength to the team and helps overcome the
   fear of implementing blockchain in the cold supply chain. A good leader
   demonstrates good administrative skills and focus on security and
   privacy policies.Originality/valueThis is a novel contribution towards
   analysing the key barriers to implementing blockchain technology in the
   South African cold supply chain using the integrated ISM-MICMAC and SEM
   approach.},

	abstract = {The incorporation of digital technologies in hotels worldwide is moving
   forward at the same pace as the recovery of the tourism sector itself
   following the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers have looked at this topic
   from the perspective of suppliers and consumers, but little research has
   been carried out on hotels' internal digitalisation processes and
   understanding their technological priorities to become more competitive.
   Atomization of hotel business structure and its characteristics and
   composition have traditionally hindered data collection. This research
   addresses this gap through close collaboration with the regional
   associative structure. The initial hypothesis is that digitization in
   Andalusian hotels flows at different speeds. The aim of the present
   study is to establish both the current state and the speed of digital
   transformation in hotels. To this end, there is an analysis of the
   degree of implementation of digital technologies in the hotel sector
   based on a case study of Andalusia (Spain). A mixed method approach is
   used, combining two focus groups that together contain 14 stakeholders,
   with 183 technological implementation surveys sent to hotels. This
   approach allows differentiation between the values of hotels
   specifically and those of accommodation as a whole, using two blocks of
   questions: technological solutions and tools; and infrastructures,
   integrations and data analysis. The results allow the validation of the
   initial hypothesis and show digital transition at two different speeds.
   The solutions and tools implemented, the technological priorities of
   future implementation and the use of digital enablers each display very
   disparate realities. Accelerating the rhythm of digitalisation is a
   great challenge for all hotels, whatever their category. The study
   contributes an original theoretical-practical model, whose method can be
   applied to other tourist destinations, regardless of their nationality.
   It enables comparisons and measurements, addressing both the typology of
   technological tools and solutions, and digitalisation issues.},

	abstract = {This research explores the interplay between innovation, economic
   systems, governance structures, and law, and how they interact with one
   another in the context of China and Ethiopia's investments in the
   Digital Silk Road. The way cutting-edge methods related to governance
   and economic systems might help lower the risks involved in major
   infrastructure projects, like the Digital Silk Road, particularly in
   light of law and 5G developments, is investigated. China-Africa
   connections are to be strengthened, sustainable development is to be
   encouraged, and healthy economic progress is the goal of the partnership
   between Ethiopia and the Hainan Free Trade Port. The impact of these
   transnational investments on fair growth and sustainable development is
   assessed, while exploring the evolving agendas and procedures governing
   investments. This research draws attention to how the law and legal
   cooperation between Ethiopia and China may promote mutually advantageous
   outcomes, promote transparency and governance mechanisms, and lessen the
   likelihood of disputes. This research on the factors influencing the
   future of the Digital Silk Road and its consequences for long-term,
   sustainable economic growth, and business in the area, aims to provide
   valuable insights for policymakers, development professionals, and
   academics, and for the copromotion of China and Ethiopia in terms of
   digital investment. This research relates to the promotion of the
   African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), in terms of construction
   and economic development. It also examines how the DSR raises concerns
   about data security and privacy, cross-border transactions, technology
   transfer, and cyberterrorism, as well as encourages digital investment,
   such as through enhancing digital governance regulations, modernizing
   international investment agreements (IIAs), and bolstering global
   health, coordination, and cooperation; the article concludes by
   analyzing the implications for Africa. The findings show that such
   cooperation would support Africa's digital transformation and
   sustainable development, while strengthening China-Africa cooperation.},

	abstract = {Background Digital transformation in healthcare and the growth of health
   data generation and collection are important challenges for the
   secondary use of healthcare records in the health research field.
   Likewise, due to the ethical and legal constraints for using sensitive
   data, understanding how health data are managed by dedicated
   infrastructures called data hubs is essential to facilitating data
   sharing and reuse.
   Methods To capture the different data governance behind health data hubs
   across Europe, a survey focused on analysing the feasibility of linking
   individual-level data between data collections and the generation of
   health data governance patterns was carried out. The target audience of
   this study was national, European, and global data hubs. In total, the
   designed survey was sent to a representative list of 99 health data hubs
   in January 2022.
   Results In total, 41 survey responses received until June 2022 were
   analysed. Stratification methods were performed to cover the different
   levels of granularity identified in some data hubs' characteristics.
   Firstly, a general pattern of data governance for data hubs was defined.
   Afterward, specific profiles were defined, generating specific data
   governance patterns through the stratifications in terms of the kind of
   organization (centralized versus decentralized) and role (data
   controller or data processor) of the health data hub respondents.
   Conclusions The analysis of the responses from health data hub
   respondents across Europe provided a list of the most frequent aspects,
   which concluded with a set of specific best practices on data management
   and governance, taking into account the constraints of sensitive data.
   In summary, a data hub should work in a centralized way, providing a
   Data Processing Agreement and a formal procedure to identify data
   providers, as well as data quality control, data integrity and
   anonymization methods.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the Government as a Platform (GaaP) based on cloud computing
   and network, has come to be considered a new structure to manage
   efficiently data-driven administration in the public sector. When the
   GaaP concept was first introduced, the ICT infrastructures that could
   underpin GaaP were not sufficiently developed. However, the recent
   digital transformation has transformed the previous electronic
   government, which was system- and architecture-oriented. As part of the
   next generation of government models, GaaP may reinvent the government
   at a lower cost but with better performance, similar to the case of
   electronic government two decades ago. This study attempted to determine
   the priority of factors of GaaP by using the analytic hierarchy process
   (AHP) methodology. Because of the GaaP characteristics, we drew the main
   components for building GaaP from previous studies and a group interview
   with experts. The study results show that experts tend to prefer
   publicness in terms of building GaaP. Most of the factors that the
   experts weighed with the highest importance are related to the public
   sector, which revealed that governments should focus on their primary
   duty, regardless of the origin and characteristics of the platform in
   GaaP. However, since GaaP allows governments to be more horizontal and
   innovative, the platform approach can fundamentally shift the existing
   processes and culture of the public sector. The enhanced activity of
   citizens with ICT can also accelerate the introduction of GaaP. Finally,
   the study showed that a data-driven GaaP is necessary to efficiently
   handle big data, contract services, and multiple levels of on-line and
   off-line channels. In this public platform, government, citizens, and
   private sector organizations can work cooperatively as partners to
   seamlessly govern the hyper-connected society.},

	abstract = {The primary objective of this study survey is to close knowledge gaps by
   measuring the responses from construction experts and investigating the
   significant effects of using digital technologies in construction
   information management (CIM). This is attributed to the lack of thorough
   knowledge among construction professionals on the implications and
   efficacy of incorporating digital tools in construction information
   management. A thorough analysis of the literature on the use of digital
   technologies revealed outcomes related to digitized ways of managing
   construction information, which were then contextually tailored through
   a pilot study and presented in the form of a postulated model. A total
   of 257 stakeholders in the building industry were given questionnaire
   surveys to complete in order to gather primary data. The final model of
   the result of adopting digital technology was statistically validated
   using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). By
   concentrating on the quantitative contribution of the most important
   result to the adoption of digital technologies throughout the process of
   CIM, this study closes this knowledge gap. The three primary benefits
   that digital technologies have the most influence on are communication,
   operational efficiency, and market intelligence, according to this
   paper's conclusions. The research showed that encouraging relationships
   that enable the use of digital technologies should be promoted between
   technology providers and construction companies. In order to adopt and
   improve digital solutions, construction firms and technology providers
   will be able to collaborate in an ecosystem. By shedding light on the
   implementation and impact of digital technologies in the construction
   sector, the study helps to close this knowledge gap. The study offers
   valuable information for upcoming initiatives that support digital
   transformation through construction methods. The results serve as
   instructions for the government authorities to help them focus their
   efforts and distribute their resources more effectively.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The primary care physician's traditional patient contacts are
   challenged by the rapidly accelerating digital transformation. In a
   quantitative survey analysis based on the theory of planned behavior, we
   found high behavioral intention to use telemedicine among Swedish
   primary care physicians, but low reported use. The aim of this study was
   to further examine the physicians' experiences regarding telemedicine,
   with a focus on possible explanations for the gap between intention and
   use, through analysis of the free-text comments supplied in the survey.
   Material and Methods: The material was collected through a web-based
   survey which was sent out to physicians at 160 primary health care
   centers in southern Sweden from May to August 2019. The survey covered
   four areas: general experiences of telemedicine, digital contacts,
   chronic disease monitoring with digital tools, and artificial
   intelligence. A total of 100 physicians submitted one or more free-text
   comments. These were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with an
   inductive approach.
   Results: The primary care physicians expressed attitudes towards
   telemedicine that focused on clinical usefulness. Barriers to use were
   the loss of personal contact with patients and a deficient technological
   infrastructure. The major concerns were that these factors would result
   in patient harm and an increased workload. The connection between
   intention and use postulated by the theory of planned behavior was not
   applicable in this context, as external factors in the form of
   availability and clinical usefulness of the specific technology were
   major impediments to use despite a generally positive attitude.
   Conclusion: All telemedicine tools must be evaluated regarding clinical
   usefulness, patient safety, and effects on staff workload, and end users
   should be included in this process. Utmost consideration is needed
   regarding how to retain the benefits of personal contact between patient
   and provider when digital solutions are introduced.},

	abstract = {Background: The world is moving fast toward digital transformation as we
   live in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. The COVID-19 pandemic
   accelerates this movement. Chatbots were used successfully to help
   researchers collect data for research purposes. Objective: To implement
   a chatbot on the Facebook platform to establish connections with health
   care professionals who had subscribed to the chatbot, provide medical
   and pharmaceutical educational content, and collect data for online
   pharmacy research projects. Facebook was chosen because it has billions
   of daily active users, which offers a massive potential audience for
   research projects.Practice description: The chatbot was successfully
   implemented on the Facebook platform following 3 consecutive steps.
   Firstly, the ChatPion script was installed on the Pharmind website to
   establish the chatbot system. Secondly, the PharmindBot application was
   developed on Facebook. Finally, the PharmindBot app was integrated with
   the chatbot system.Practice innovation: The chatbot responds
   automatically to public comments and sends sub-scribers private
   responses using AI. The chatbot collected quantitative and qualitative
   data with minimal costs.Evaluation methods: The chatbot's auto-reply
   function was tested using a post published on a specific page on
   Facebook. Testers were asked to leave predefined keywords to test its
   functionality. The chatbot's ability to collect and save data was tested
   by asking testers to fill out an online survey within Facebook Messenger
   for quantitative data and answer predefined questions for qualitative
   data.Results: The chatbot was tested on 1000 subscribers who interacted
   with it. Almost all testers (n = 990, 99\%) obtained a successful
   private reply from the chatbot after sending a predefined keyword. Also,
   the chatbot replied privately to almost all public comments (n = 985,
   98.5\%) which helped to increase the organic reach and to establish a
   connection with the chatbot subscribers. No missing data were found when
   the chatbot was used to collect quantitative and qualitative
   data.Conclusions: The chatbot reached thousands of health care
   professionals and provided them with automated responses. At a low cost,
   the chatbot was able to gather both qualitative and quantitative data
   without relying on Facebook ads to reach the intended audience. The data
   collection was efficient and effective. Using chatbots by pharmacy and
   medical researchers will help do more feasible online studies using AI
   to advance health care research.(c) 2023 American Pharmacists

	abstract = {Healthcare data is highly sensitive and must be safeguarded. Personal
   and sensitive data, such as names and addresses, is stored in Encrypted
   Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This paper proposes a Blockchain-based
   distributed application platform for Bangladesh's public and private
   healthcare service providers. The proposed application framework enables
   users to create secure digital agreements for commerce or collaboration
   by leveraging data immutability and smart contracts. As a result, all
   stakeholders can collaborate securely over the same Blockchain network,
   taking advantage of their data's openness and read/write nature. The
   proposed application is made up of various application interfaces for
   various stakeholders. The proposed solution employs Hyperledger Fabric
   and Blockchain to ensure data integrity, privacy, permissions, and
   service availability. In the application portal, each user has a
   profile. The creation of a unique identity for each user, as well as the
   establishment of digital information centers across the country, has
   greatly aided the process. This application collects health data from
   each user in a systematic manner, which is useful for research
   institutes and healthcare-related organizations. For this application, a
   national data warehouse in Bangladesh is feasible, and various
   healthcare-related analyses can be performed using the collected data,
   assisting the strategy and planning department in making informed
   decisions regarding the healthcare sector in Bangladesh. Because
   Bangladesh has both public and private healthcare providers, a simple
   digital strategy is essential for all organizations to accomplish their
   services. This study proposes a solution to achieve this goal.},

	abstract = {The willingness of individuals to provide personal data is of interest
   to policymakers and practitioners seeking to develop more intelligent
   transportation systems that create value for passengers using
   technologies, as well as to leverage the use of data more generally to
   accelerate digital transformation. This study examines the role of
   perceived benefits as a driver and necessary condition for the
   willingness of air passengers to provide personal data for non mandatory
   digital services at airports. These are services that are not essential
   for the operation of the airport or for the safety and security of
   passengers but can enhance the passenger experience or generate
   additional revenue for the airport. Examples include receiving
   notifications to a mobile device about their journey and related
   products and services, accessing customer services online, joining and
   receiving electronic information from an airport loyalty programme, and
   making payments for products and services online or via a mobile
   application. The analysis is based on two samples of 235 and 218
   respondents to an online survey where the second sample is used for the
   purpose of replication. Responses were analysed using a recently
   developed complementary approach that combines partial least squares
   structural equation modeling and necessary condition analysis. The
   findings confirm that perceived benefits are a significant driver and
   necessary condition for passengers' willingness to provide personal
   data. More so, perceived benefits significantly attenuate the negative
   effect that privacy concerns have on passengers' willingness to provide
   personal data. The findings offer theoretical and methodological
   contributions, as well as implications for policy and practice.},

	abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate how different
   manufacturing technologies are bundled together and how these bundles
   influence operations performance and, indirectly, business performance.
   With the emergence of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies, manufacturing
   companies can use a wide variety of advanced manufacturing technologies
   (AMT) to build an efficient and effective production system.
   Nevertheless, the literature offers little guidance on how these
   technologies, including novel I4.0 technologies, should be combined in
   practice and how these combinations might have a different impact on
   performance.Design/methodology/approachUsing a survey study of 165
   manufacturing plants from 11 different countries, we use factor analysis
   to empirically derive three distinct manufacturing technology bundles
   and structural equation modeling to quantify their relationship with
   operations and business performance.FindingsOur findings support an
   evolutionary rather than a revolutionary perspective. I4.0 technologies
   build on traditional manufacturing technologies and do not constitute a
   separate direction that would point towards a fundamental digital
   transformation of companies within our sample. Performance effects are
   rather weak: out of the three technology bundles identified, only
   ``automation and robotization{''} have a positive influence on cost
   efficiency, while ``base technologies{''} and ``data-enabled
   technologies{''} do not offer a competitive advantage, neither in terms
   of cost nor in terms of differentiation. Furthermore, while the business
   performance impact is positive, it is quite weak, suggesting that
   financial returns on technology investments might require longer time
   periods.Originality/valueRelying on a complementarity approach, our
   research offers a novel perspective on technology implementation in the
   I4.0 era by investigating novel and traditional manufacturing
   technologies together.},

	abstract = {How can local governments in the Global South effectively implement and
   sustain digital public participation initiatives, and what specific
   roles do public officials and knowledge intermediaries play in
   catalysing and supporting this digital transformation? In this paper, we
   respond to this query by examining our experiences as researchers in
   implementing an ongoing multi-year applied research project on
   e-participation and policy modelling in various South African
   municipalities. The project and the country's ongoing public
   participation initiatives align with government policy emphasising
   citizen-centric public service delivery through consultation,
   transparency, and accountability. We aim to highlight the practical
   aspects of introducing e-participation mechanisms in local governance
   structures with different human and material resource capacity levels,
   which is the case in Global South contexts. Our central question is as
   follows: How can public officials, working alongside researchers and
   knowledge intermediaries, navigate the sustainable adoption of
   e-participation through participatory design, system awareness, and
   bricolage? We explore this question from the perspective of researchers
   leading the implementation of a multi-year, participatory
   action-research project which aims to pilot e-participation in six
   municipalities across South Africa. In the paper, we analyse the
   interplay of various socio-technical factors influencing the early
   stages of implementation and use of e-participation tools in local
   government. Our findings highlight the importance of building
   socio-technical agency of front-line public participation officials,
   exploring malleable technologies that are flexible to adaptation,
   facilitating peer-learning amongst officials on what works in similar
   contexts, and having a system view within and across pilots.},

   Federation (NSF) which allows orchestration of external domain
   services/resources to provide a zero-downtime end-to-end vertical
   service. Distributed ledger technologies, such as Blockchain, are used
   to enhance the federation process. In this article, we propose and
   evaluate the application of Blockchain technology for NSF. We evaluate
   four different consensus mechanisms: Proof-of-Work (PoW),
   Proof-of-Authority (PoA), Practical Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (PBFT), and
   Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The experimental evaluation is executed using
   Ethereum, Tendermint and Cosmos platforms. Results show that the
   evaluated consensus mechanisms enable the use of NSF for both
   latency-sensitive and security stringent vertical applications.},

	abstract = {Background:The digital transformation of medical data presents
   opportunities for novel approaches to manage patients with persistent
   hypertension. We sought to develop an actionable taxonomy of patients
   with persistent hypertension (defined as 5 or more consecutive
   measurements of blood pressure >= 160/100 mmHg over time) based on data
   from the electronic health records. Methods:This qualitative study was a
   content analysis of clinician notes in the electronic health records of
   patients in the Yale New Haven Health System. Eligible patients were 18
   to 85 years and had blood pressure >= 160/100 mmHg at 5 or more
   consecutive outpatient visits between January 1, 2013 and October 31,
   2018. A total of 1664 patients met criteria, of which 200 records were
   randomly selected for chart review. Through a systematic, inductive
   approach, we developed a rubric to abstract data from the electronic
   health records and then analyzed the abstracted data qualitatively using
   conventional content analysis until saturation was reached. Results:We
   reached saturation with 115 patients, who had a mean age of 66.0 (SD,
   11.6) years; 54.8\% were female; 52.2\%, 30.4\%, and 13.9\% were White,
   Black, and Hispanic patients. We identified 3 content domains related to
   persistence of hypertension: (1) non-intensification of pharmacological
   treatment, defined as absence of antihypertensive treatment
   intensification in response to persistent severely elevated blood
   pressure; (2) non-implementation of prescribed treatment, defined as a
   documentation of provider recommending a specified treatment plan to
   address hypertension but treatment plan not being implemented; and (3)
   non-response to prescribed treatment, defined as clinician-acknowledged
   persistent hypertension despite documented effort to escalate existing
   pharmacologic agents and addition of additional pharmacologic agents
   with presumption of adherence. Conclusions:This study presents a novel
   actionable taxonomy for classifying patients with persistent
   hypertension by their contributing causes based on electronic health
   record data. These categories can be automated and linked to specific
   types of actions to address them.},

@article{WOS:000732521500001,
	abstract = {Since the late 2000s, digital platforms have developed rapidly and
   expanded extensively to various industries of the global economy.
   Existing literature on the rise of digital platforms has primarily
   focused on the national-level context, while overlooking their
   cross-border dynamics and subsequent effects on the reconfiguration of
   cross-border production networks/value chains. Among the agri-food
   sector, the fresh fruits sector is one of many that have undergone
   profound restructuring induced by the increasing penetration of digital
   platforms. In an attempt at making connections between the insights of
   the burgeoning platforms and global production networks (GPN)/global
   value chains (GVC) literatures, this study develops an interconnected
   analytical framework to examine the cross-border expansion of China's
   digital platforms and resultant digital platform-driven transformation
   of regional trade and distribution networks/value chains in the evolving
   regulatory and market conditions in home and host countries. Based on
   the onsite field investigations in Vietnam, Thailand and China during
   the late 2018 and early 2020, this study explores the emerging platform
   conglomerates through domestic intra-platform and cross-border
   interplatform vertical integration and extra-platform partnership in the
   cross-border expansion to the upstream trade and downstream distribution
   of fresh fruit imports from Southeast Asia toward China's market. The
   contributions of the article lie in three aspects. First, it enriches
   the platform literature by incorporating the cross-border dynamics and
   expansion of digital platforms. Second, it advances the GPN/GVC
   literature by highlighting the power of digital platforms as new types
   of lead firms in the digital transformation of production networks/value
   chains. Third, it sheds light on the emerging China market-oriented
   reconfiguration of the Southeast Asian fresh fruit production networks
   coordinated by the Chinese platform conglomerates. The analytical
   framework developed in this study could hopefully be extended to examine
   digital platform-driven restructuring of a wider array of industries
   across variegated territories in the digital global economy.},

	abstract = {Background Social constructs like race can affect how patients are
   perceived and impact care.This study investigated whether mentions of
   race in notes for critically ill patients differed according to
   patients' race. Methods This retrospective cohort study included
   intensive care unit notes for adults (>= 18 years old) admitted to any
   of 6 intensive care units at University of California, San Francisco,
   from 2012 through 2020. Notes were linked to National Provider
   Identifier records to obtain note writer characteristics. Logistic
   regression analysis with robust SEs clustered on note writers was
   adjusted for patient-, note- and clinician-level characteristics. Any
   race or ethnicity mention was the outcome of interest. Results Among
   5573 patients with 292 457 notes by 9742 unique note writers, 3225
   patients (57.9\%) self-reported their race as White, 997 (17.9\%) as
   Asian, 860 (15.4\%) as Latinx, and 491 (8.8\%) as Black. Note writers
   documented race/ethnicity for 20.8\% of Black, 10.9\% of Latinx, 9.1\%
   of White, and 4.4\% of Asian patients. Black patients were more likely
   than White patients to have race mentioned in notes (adjusted odds
   ratio, 2.05 {[}95\% CI, 1.49-2.82]). Conclusions Black patients were
   more than twice as likely as White patients to have race mentioned in
   notes. Note language containing information on social constructs has
   consequences for clinicians and patients reading notes and for
   algorithms trained on clinical notes. ( American Journal of Critical

	abstract = {This study focuses on one of the most impacted human aspects of digital
   transformation in contemporary organizations: the development of the
   affective commitment of newcomers in hybrid work contexts. Specifically,
   this study addresses a research gap related to the factors that
   influence the affective commitment of newcomers in hybrid work contexts.
   First, it investigates the role of two drawbacks of the remote component
   of hybrid work contexts inhibiting affective commitment: workplace
   social isolation and technostress. Second, it explores the role of two
   factors that were previously investigated in in-presence contexts and
   proved to enhance affective commitment: perceived organizational support
   and perceived supervisor support. Moreover, this study considers the
   possible mediating role of newcomer adjustment, intended as a proximal
   outcome of successful onboarding and an antecedent of newcomer affective
   commitment. In order to examine enhancing and inhibiting factors and the
   mediating role of newcomer adjustment, a quantitative study was carried
   out involving newcomers who began to work in their current organization
   after January 2021 and who still do remote work at least 1 day a week.
   Results confirm the inhibiting role of workplace social isolation and
   the enhancing role of perceived organizational support and perceived
   supervisor support on affective commitment in hybrid work contexts.
   Furthermore, they support the mediating role of newcomer adjustment in
   the relationship between workplace social isolation and affective
   commitment. While contributing to theory advancement in understanding
   newcomer affective commitment in current hybrid work contexts, these
   results also suggest important managerial implications in the field of
   human resources management, specifically the need to pay greater
   attention to strategies devoted to increasing newcomers' perception of
   organizational and supervisor support.},

@article{WOS:000678731800001,
	abstract = {Purpose This research responds to a growing interest among cultural
   organizations regarding how to use emerging digital technologies in the
   communication of cultural content. The need to investigate various
   aspects of digital transformation for cultural organizations has been
   heightened during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This
   paper explores how city cultural organizations can utilize digital
   stories for impression management to enhance public perceptions of a
   city. The aim of this study is to understand how end-users are affected
   by a city cultural digital storytelling information system and the
   benefits of using such a system. Design/methodology/approach An
   interpretive case study was conducted on a digital storytelling
   initiative carried out by three cultural organizations in a medium-sized
   city in Canada. Data collection included 95 interviews with the general
   public, questionnaires and the gathering of documents. Findings Findings
   suggest that digital storytelling can be a viable tool to share city
   cultural heritage information and positively affect end-user perceptions
   of a city. The overall outcome of creating/maintaining a positive
   favorable impression is shaped through a layered experience of benefits
   by users. Through digital stories, users are first personally engaged
   and informed about a city's cultural heritage, and then they are
   influenced and inspired positively toward the city. Further, factors,
   such as leisure learning, cultural heritage information and cultural
   organizations, situate this context of use. Originality/value The study
   sheds light on how the art of storytelling in the digital age can serve
   as a powerful tool for conveying information effectively and influencing
   public perceptions. This paper provides a context-specific model to
   understand the use of digital storytelling by city cultural
   organizations for the purpose of impression management. Theoretical
   insights and practical recommendations are provided to explore the
   utilization of digital storytelling for raising interest and awareness
   in a city and managing public perceptions.},

	abstract = {Context: The domain of rural areas, including rural communities,
   agriculture, and forestry, is going through a process of deep digital
   transformation. Digitalisation can have positive impacts on
   sustainability in terms of greater environmental control, and community
   prosperity. At the same time, it can also have disruptive effects, with
   the marginalisation of actors that cannot cope with the change. When
   developing a novel system for rural areas, requirements engineers should
   carefully consider the specific socio-economic characteristics of the
   domain, so that potential positive effects can be maximised, while
   mitigating negative impacts. Objective: The goal of this paper is to
   support requirements engineers with a reference catalogue of drivers,
   barriers and potential impacts associated to the introduction of novel
   ICT solutions in rural areas. Method: To this end, we interview 30
   cross-disciplinary experts in digitalisation of rural areas, and we
   analyse the transcripts to identify common themes. Results: According to
   the experts, main drivers are economic, with the possibility of reducing
   costs, and regulatory, as institutions push for more precise tracing and
   monitoring of production; barriers are the limited connectivity, but
   also distrust towards technology and other socio-cultural aspects;
   positive impacts are socioeconomic (e.g., reduction of manual labour,
   greater productivity), while negative ones include potential dependency
   from technology, with loss of hands-on expertise, and marginalisation of
   certain actors (e.g., small farms, subjects with limited education).
   Conclusion: This paper contributes to the literature with a
   domain-specific catalogue that characterises digitalisation in rural
   areas. The catalogue can be used as a reference baseline for
   requirements elicitation endeavours in rural areas, to support domain
   analysis prior to the development of novel solutions, as well as fit-gap
   analysis for the adaptation of existing technologies.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the healthcare sector has undergone a significant
   digital transformation, driven by the rise of the Internet of Medical
   Things and the exponential use of connected medical devices in
   healthcare service delivery. This transformation offers numerous
   benefits, including enhanced patient data collection, processing, and
   informed treatment decisions. Despite these advantages, digital adoption
   brings several security challenges that pose considerable risks to
   overall healthcare service delivery. Additionally, connected medical
   devices must comply with sector-specific regulatory requirements to
   ensure trustworthiness and facilitate their broader adoption in the
   healthcare sector. There is, therefore, a pressing need to understand
   and manage these risks and compliance issues to secure and strengthen
   the resilience of healthcare systems. This work addresses these needs by
   introducing a novel Risk and Conformity Assessment Framework and
   Certification Scheme, implemented within an agile Information Security
   Management System context to enhance the security and resilience of
   healthcare systems. The framework leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   in risk management practices, improving security assessments, risk
   prediction, security control implementation, and continuous monitoring.
   AI algorithms analyze large data volumes from various sources, enabling
   efficient processing and the identification of potential risk patterns.
   Additionally, AI-driven automation tools ensure consistent deployment of
   security controls, while continuous AI monitoring detects abnormal
   activities and enables rapid response to security incidents. The
   proposed Cybersecurity Certification Scheme incorporates AI-based
   security assessments into the certification process, facilitating
   efficient conformity assurance. This scheme also promotes a
   collaborative approach with relevant regulatory bodies to achieve
   compliance. While this work introduces a conceptual framework, its
   implementation and potential refinements remain subjects for future
   research. Further studies are necessary to validate its effectiveness,
   enhance its components, and evaluate its practical application in
   real-world healthcare environments.},

@article{WOS:001352367800002,
	abstract = {Persistent and toxic chemicals remain a significant pollution concern,
   underscored by the European Union's Zero Pollution Action Plan. Daily
   exposure to complex chemical mixtures starts early and continues
   throughout life, for instance for consumer products such as toys,
   plasticware, furniture, and synthetic fibres. EU-funded research
   projects like COPHES/DEMOCOPHES, HBM4EU, and PARC have documented
   population exposure to these substances. The outcomes of such research
   initiatives have contributed to highlighting the adverse health impacts
   of Substances of Concern (SoCs), leading to several regulatory actions
   within the EU. SoCs include hazardous chemicals such as carcinogens,
   mutagens, endocrine disruptors, and ``persistent, bioaccumulative, and
   mobile{''} (PBM) chemicals. The digital transformation in chemicals
   management has resulted in policies that mandate electronic submissions
   of chemical risk assessment-relevant data, and the creation of
   industry-specific databases like the Substances of Concern in Products
   (SCIP) database, established by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)
   under the revised Waste Framework Directive (WstFD). These databases
   describe SoCs and their link with products, offering a comprehensive
   view of chemical quantities, emission sources, exposure pathways, and
   other relevant data, contingent on robust data governance. Effective
   chemical risk assessment requires characterizing hazards, exposure
   sources and levels, and drawing conclusions concluding on potential
   risks, supported by a well-defined problem formulation and monitoring.
   This includes setting objectives and defining the scope of the risk
   assessment and decision-making, particularly regarding early warning
   signal detection for the purpose of public health protection. Successful
   risk assessment hinges on access to robust, traceable, accessible, and
   interoperable data across scientific disciplines and regulatory
   frameworks. This paper discusses the challenges of aggregating human
   health risk assessment-relevant chemical information from multiple
   sources, especially from the perspective of data fusion and reuse. It
   presents findings from a research project focused on utilizing chemicals
   datasets from various governmental and scientific sources. The study
   highlights the need for improved data presentation and availability to
   enhance usability for all stakeholders. Recommendations are made for the
   EU Commission, ECHA, industry, and academia to support harmonized data
   practices, increased transparency, and the development of sustainable
   chemical applications fostering safer market introductions. These
   recommendations can also be useful to other data providers that care
   about the reusability of the data they publish or manage.},

@article{WOS:000693241500009,
	abstract = {Background Welfare technology has been launched as a concept to
   accelerate digital transformation in care services, but the deployment
   of these technologies is still hindered by organisational resistance,
   lack of infrastructure, and juridical and ethical issues. This paper
   investigates decision-making among municipal actors in the application
   and deployment of welfare technology from a procurement process
   perspective. The study explores the perceptions and negotiations
   involved in purchasing welfare technology at each stage of the
   procurement model, revealing the impact of technical, economic,
   juridical and ethical competence on the mapping, planning, procurement,
   implementation and management of welfare technology. Methods The study
   presents empirical findings from qualitative interviews conducted among
   municipal actors in Sweden. Semi-structured interviews were gathered in
   2020 among procurement managers, IT managers, and managers in social
   administration in three different municipalities (n = 8). Content
   analysis and systematic categorisation were applied resulting in the
   division of procurement practices into sub-categories, generic
   categories and main categories. Results Challenges in the application
   and deployment of welfare technology occur at all stages of the
   procurement model. In mapping and planning, barriers are identified in
   the need analysis, requirement specification and market analysis. In the
   procurement stage, economic resources, standardisation and
   interoperability hinder the procurement process. Implementation and
   management are complicated by supplier assessment, legislation,
   cross-organisational collaboration and political strategy. Building on
   these findings, this study defines `procurement competence' as
   consisting of technical, economic, juridical and ethical expertise in
   order to assess and evaluate welfare technology. Technical and ethical
   competence is needed in early stages of procurement, whereas juridical
   and economic competence relates to later stages of the model.
   Conclusions Procurement competence is associated with the application
   and deployment of welfare technology in (1) assessment of the end-user's
   needs, (2) estimation of the costs and benefits of welfare technology
   and (3) management of juridical and legislative issues in data
   management. Economic and juridical decisions to purchase welfare
   technology are not value-neutral, but rather associated with socially
   shared understandings of technological possibilities in care provision.
   Optimisation of procurement processes requires a combination of
   capabilities to introduce, apply and deploy welfare technology that
   meets the demands and needs of end-users.},

	abstract = {Given the increasing complexity of the global supply chain, it is an
   important issue to enhance the agilities of enterprises that manufacture
   new energy materials to reduce the ripple effects of supply chains.
   Quality function deployment (QFD) has been applied in many areas to
   solve multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems successfully.
   However, there is still lack of sufficient research on the use of MCDM
   to develop two house-of-quality systems in the supply chain of new
   energy materials manufacturing enterprises to determine ripple effect
   factors (REFs), supply chain agility indicators (SCAIs), and industry
   4.0 enablers (I4Es). This study aimed to develop a valuable decision
   framework by integrating MCDM and QFD; using key I4Es to enhance the
   agility of supply chain and reduce or mitigate its ripple effects
   ultimately, this study provides an effective method for new energy
   materials manufacturers to develop supply chains that can rapidly
   respond to change and uncertainty. The case study considered China's
   largest new energy materials manufacturing enterprise as the object and
   obtained important management insights, as well as practical
   significance, from implementing the proposed research framework. The
   study found the following to be the most urgent I4Es required to
   strengthen the agility of supply chain and reduce the key REFs: ensuring
   data privacy and security, guarding against legal risks, adopting
   digital transformation investment to improve economic efficiency,
   ramming IT infrastructure for big data management, and investing and
   using the new equipment of Industry 4.0. When these measures are
   improved, the agility of the supply chain can be improved, such as
   long-term cooperation with partners to strengthen trust relationships,
   supply chain information transparency and visualization to quickly
   respond to customer needs, and improving customer service levels and
   satisfaction. Finally, REFs, such as the bullwhip effect caused by
   inaccurate prediction, facility failure, and poor strain capacity caused
   by supply chain disruption, can be alleviated or eliminated. The
   proposed framework provides an effective strategy for formulating I4Es
   to strengthen supply chain agility (SCA) and mitigate ripple effects, as
   well as provides a reference for supply chain management of other
   manufacturing enterprises in the field of cleaner production.},

	abstract = {Background: Implementation of an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) in a
   key milestone in the digital strategy of modern healthcare
   organisations. The implementation of EPR systems can be viewed as
   challenging and complex. Objective: The aim of the study was to
   investigate user perspectives and experiences of the implementation of
   an Electronic Medical Record in a major academic teaching hospital, with
   simultaneous `go-live' across the whole hospital taking place. Methods:
   Focus groups and individual in-depth interviews were conducted with
   stakeholders and users (n = 105), approximately nine months post-EPR
   implementation. The study explored EPR users' perceptions using an
   extended theoretical framework of the DeLone and McLean Information
   Systems Success Model (2003), which measured information systems, system
   quality, information quality, service quality, use/perceived usefulness
   \& user satisfaction and net benefits. Results: Staff engagement and
   satisfaction was high and the EPR is accepted as the new standard way of
   completing care. There was agreement that the EPR affords transparency,
   and greater accountability. There was some concern expressed regarding
   impact of the EPR on interprofessional and patient/provider interactions
   and communication. Physicians reported the inputting of social history
   through free text as an issue of concern and time consuming. The Big
   Bang approach with mandatory conversion was key to the successful
   adoption of EPR. There was consensus across professional and
   administrative respondents that there was no appetite to return to
   paper-based records. Conclusion: The successful roll out of the EPR
   reflects the digital readiness of healthcare providers and
   organisations. The potential for unintended consequences on work process
   requires continual monitoring. A key future benefit of the EPR will be
   the capacity to reach a broader understanding and analysis of variation
   in processes and outcomes within healthcare organisations. It is clear
   that skills in data analytics will be needed to mine data successfully.},

	abstract = {Despite evidence showing the feasibility and acceptability of
   implementing the World Health Organization's guidelines on managing
   possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) in Kenya, the initial
   implementation revealed sub-optimal community-facility referrals and
   follow-up of PSBI cases. This study explores facilitators and barriers
   of community-facility linkages in implementing PSBI guidelines in Busia
   and Migori counties, Kenya. We used an exploratory qualitative study
   design drawing on endline evaluation data from the `COVID-19: Mitigating
   Neonatal Mortality' project collected between June and July 2022. Data
   include case narratives with caregivers of sick young infants (0-59 days
   old) (18), focus group discussions with community health volunteers
   (CHVs) (6), and in-depth interviews with facility-based providers (18).
   Data were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis framework.
   Between August 2021 and July 2022, CHVs assessed 10 187 newborns, with
   1176 (12\%) identified with PSBI danger signs and referred to the
   nearest facility, of which 820 (70\%) accepted referral. Analysis
   revealed several factors facilitating community-facility linkage for
   PSBI treatment, including CHVs' relationship with community members and
   facilities, availability of a CHV desk and tools, use of mobile app,
   training and supportive supervision. However, challenges such as health
   system-related factors (inadequate providers, stockout of essential
   commodities and supplies, and lack of transport/ambulance) and
   individual-related factors (caregivers' refusal to take referrals)
   hindered community-facility linkage. Addressing common barriers and
   fostering positive relationships between community health workers and
   facilities can enhance acceptance and access to PSBI services at the
   community level. Combining community health workers' efforts with a
   mobile digital strategy can improve the efficiency of the
   identification, referral and tracking of PSBI cases in the community and
   facilitate linkage with primary healthcare facilities.},

	abstract = {Britain is almost unique in giving its incumbent public service
   broadcaster, the BBC, a leading role in driving digital, thereby hoping
   to hasten digital take-up, and thus allowing analogue switch-off by
   2012. This paper is divided into two parts. The first part investigates
   the recent historical past with respect to the making of policy, drawing
   on the analytical framework of policy cycles. Why has the British
   government given the BBC a lead role in the move towards digital and how
   does this decision link and interconnect with other interweaving policy
   debates surrounding the BBC licence fee and Charter renewal? In a media
   environment, increasingly driven by commercial considerations, what are
   the key policy motivations for entrusting a publicly funded institution
   with a lead role in the digital era, and what have been the main
   challenges and policy dilemmas in doing this? Part two considers how the
   BBC has responded to government policy initiatives. What are the key
   building blocks of its digital strategy and just how comfortably do
   these sit with its public service remit? For digital means much more
   than just broadcasting, demanding responses to changes in the way that
   audiences are likely to interact with content in future. Yet, in
   positioning itself as a content provider, whose content will be
   available on demand on myriad future platforms, the Corporation is
   increasingly impinging on what commercial operators believe is their
   future route to profitability. In the light of this analysis, the paper
   concludes by assessing the compatibility of government policy and BBC
   strategy given their at times diverging aims and objectives, and what
   this means for the continuance of a public service ethos into the
   digital age.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This quality improvement project evaluated interventions
   implemented to enhance individual adherence to a lung-protective
   ventilation strategy and its triad: low tidal volume, PEEP >= 5,
   recruitment manoeuvres.Methods: For two years, nine anaesthesia
   workstations were connected to an automated cloud-based analytics
   software tool, which automatically recorded ventilation parameters as
   soon as a new patient case was opened. Four quality improvement periods
   were determined over the first year: baseline, intervention, no
   intervention, intervention + digital. In the second year, the digital
   strategy was continued for nine months, followed by a final
   ``overtime{''} period. Baseline and no intervention periods included no
   training. The intervention period included both conventional and
   educational programs. The digital period included pop-up messages, which
   automatically appeared on the screen of the anaesthesia data management
   system when patients were intubated. The primary endpoint was provider
   adherence to the recommended triad.Results: From October 2018 to
   December 2020, 12,883 procedures were performed. Data were available for
   8968 procedures: baseline (n = 2361), intervention (n = 2423), no
   intervention (n = 1064), intervention + digital (n = 1862), overtime (n
   = 1258). Age, Predicted Body Weight, ASA score, type of surgery and
   airway management were similar between periods. At baseline, 75.2\% of
   procedures reported low tidal volume but only 6.9\% involved the
   complete triad. At over time, Triad was 22\% (p < 0.001). Over study
   period, each parameter of the Triad (RM, Vt and Peep) increased (p <
   0.001 vs. baseline), driving pressure decreased although EtCO2 and
   plateau pressure had not changed.Conclusion: Training with the help of
   digital apps improved LPV adherence over time.(c) 2022 Socie acute

   supply chain, with a dual focus on minimizing freight costs and delivery
   times. With the help of a dataset containing 10,325 instances of supply
   chain transactions, key variables, including ``Country{''}, ``Vendor
   INCO Term{''}, and ``Shipment Mode{''}, were examined in order to
   develop a predictive model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
   employing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture. A set of ANN
   models were trained to forecast ``freight cost{''} and ``delivery
   time{''} based on four principal design variables: ``Line Item
   Quantity{''}, ``Pack Price{''}, ``Unit of Measure (Per Pack){''}, and
   ``Weight (Kilograms){''}. According to performance metrics analysis,
   these models demonstrated predictive accuracy following training. An
   optimization algorithm, configured with an ``active-set{''} algorithm,
   was then used to minimize the combined objective function of freight
   cost and delivery time. Both freight costs and delivery times were
   significantly reduced as a result of the optimization. This study
   illustrates the potent application of machine learning and optimization
   algorithms to the enhancement of supply chain efficiency. This study
   provides a blueprint for cost reduction and improved service delivery in
   critical medication supply chains based on the methodology and outcomes.},

	abstract = {Technologies, such as Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT,
   Smart PLS version 4), are prime examples of Generative Artificial
   Intelligence (AI), which is a constantly evolving area. SMEs,
   particularly startups, can obtain a competitive edge, innovate their
   business models, gain business value, and undergo a digital
   transformation by implementing these technologies. Continuous but
   gradual experimentation with these technologies is the foundation for
   their adoption. The experience that comes from trying new technologies
   can help entrepreneurs adopt new technologies more strategically and
   experiment more with them. The urgent need for an in-depth investigation
   is highlighted by the paucity of previous research on ChatGPT uptake in
   the startup context, particularly from an entrepreneurial perspective.
   The objective of this research study is to empirically validate the
   Generative AI technology adoption model to establish the direction and
   strength of the correlations among the adoption factors from the
   perspectives of the entrepreneurs. The data are collected from 482
   entrepreneurs who exhibit great diversity in their genders, the
   countries in which their startups are located, the industries their
   startups serve, their age, their educational levels, their work
   experience as entrepreneurs, and the length of time the startups have
   been on the market. Collected data are analyzed using the Partial Least
   Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique, which results
   in a statistical examination of the relationships between the adoption
   model's factors. The results indicate that social influence, domain
   experience, technology familiarity, system quality, training and
   support, interaction convenience, and anthropomorphism are the factors
   that impact the pre-perception and perception phase of adoption. These
   factors motivate entrepreneurs to experiment more with the technology,
   thereby building perceptions of its usefulness, perceived ease of use,
   and perceived enjoyment, three factors that in turn affect emotions
   toward the technology and, finally, switching intentions. Control
   variables like age, gender, and educational attainment have no
   appreciable effect on switching intentions to alternatives of the
   Generative AI technology. Rather, the experience factor of running
   businesses shows itself to be a crucial one. The results have practical
   implications for entrepreneurs and other innovation ecosystem actors,
   including, for instance, technology providers, libraries, and
   policymakers. This research study enriches the Generative AI technology
   acceptance theory and extends the existing literature by introducing new
   adoption variables and stages specific to entrepreneurship.},

	abstract = {The top online marketplaces in the world, including Alibaba, Amazon, and
   eBay, sold \$2.7 trillion in 2020, or 62\% of global web sales that
   year. Despite the promise of unfettered access to customers, the reality
   is that most sellers struggle with unprecedented and unauthorized rogue
   resellers. These often anonymous, third-party individuals and firms may
   not provide the quality experiences aligned with customers' expectations
   of a brand and often market their goods in competition with trusted
   partners. This requires a systematic battle plan to effectively protect
   the seller's brand equity, service promise, and authorized distribution
   network. We describe the channel war that is at work and the forces
   fueling its development. We explain how rogue reseller activities drive
   down pricing, increase channel competition and conflict, impact the
   customer experience, and harm brand equity. We recommend revising
   product policies, procedures, and agreements to begin to differentiate
   products from those sold by unauthorized parties. We also recommend a
   legal strategy to complement these efforts. Critical steps include
   regular and active enforcement as well as implementing services,
   benefits, and quality controls for the brand's products that cannot be
   replicated by unauthorized sellers and requiring authorized distributors
   and retailers to maintain those benefits and controls. (c) 2021 Kelley

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2020 has significantly impacted
   businesses, regardless of size or industry. The hybrid and remote
   working models have moved all meetings with potential and existing
   suppliers to an online environment. This also applies to small- and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have had to adapt themselves to
   the new situation and implement the solutions necessary to survive on
   the market. On the other hand, clients have become more aware of the
   environment and its changes. Customers are trying to be more
   eco-friendly, by choosing and moving towards Green IT. Thus, this needs
   to be considered. The acquisition of management information systems
   (MIS) in the pandemic era is based only on virtual meetings. The main
   goals of this paper were the identification of the changes in the
   negotiations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the transformation of this
   process into virtual environment, discussion of the possibility of using
   Green IT in addition to Management Information Systems, and the changes
   caused by the pandemic. The article was prepared based on the results of
   qualitative research using the case study method. The comparative
   analysis includes purposely selected cloud-based Enterprise Resource
   Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems'
   acquisition processes, presented from the clients' perspective. The
   research was conducted in 2021, based on the authors' practical
   experience, and presents four cases. This research illustrates the
   negotiations concerning an acquisition transaction pre-pandemic and
   during the pandemic. Finally, the conclusions and main differences
   caused by the pandemic in the acquisition transaction process of
   management information systems (MIS) are presented.},

@article{WOS:001228631600001,
	abstract = {PurposeDigital platforms represent a major technological change that
   affects the entire value chain of a company and requires digital
   resources and a flexible organizational structure. Given the resource
   limitations that SMEs have, it is interesting to find out to what extent
   they have adopted digital platforms. The aim of this paper is to explore
   the level of SMEs' digitalization and how sophisticated these businesses
   are in using various digital platforms in primary and secondary value
   creation activities. Additionally, we set out to identify clusters with
   different needs and behaviors when considering digital
   platforms.Methodology/ApproachTo address these research questions, we
   conducted a survey using a quota sampling procedure to reflect the SMEs'
   structure in size and industry. We analyzed the data collected from 194
   respondents using a two-step clustering procedure to identify different
   groups of SMEs with respect to the use of digital platforms. For
   business activities, we used Porter's value chain and for assessing the
   adoption rate, we applied the Moore and Benbasat scale to measure
   adopters' perceptions of the technology.FindingsMost SMEs use general
   digital platforms while less than 20\% have developed their own
   platforms or use the platforms of business partners. Organizations with
   a hybrid structure use the largest number of digital platforms, while
   enterprises with a fluid structure use the fewest. Companies are using
   their own platforms or partners' platforms for primary activities while
   for support activities are employing general platforms. The most
   important factor which influences the adoption rate of digital platforms
   is the image and then comes the advantages they bring. Regarding the
   clusters, four distinct groups were identified with specific value
   creation behaviors Digital Pathfinders, Basic Techies, Tech Blend, and
   Flexible Adopters.Practical implicationsPractical implications concern
   both the companies that use digital platforms and the companies that
   develop them. From the user perspective, this study sets a benchmark for
   different industries and presents the most common practices Regarding
   the companies that develop digital platforms, it is important to know
   the main deterrence factors, namely the lack of testing possibilities
   and the difficulty in choosing the most suitable solution. Taking into
   account the specific needs of the four clusters, developers can adapt
   their product and value proposition to stimulate the adoption of the
   digital platform.Originality/Value/ContributionThis paper contributes to
   research on digital platforms in the context of transformational
   entrepreneurship related to crisis or catastrophic events such as
   pandemics or wars. Furthermore, it adds to existing literature on
   digital transformation by providing recommendations considering specific
   value chain activities. Although there are numerous studies on digital
   platforms, most of them come from developed countries, which makes them
   less relevant for developing/underdeveloped ones.},

@article{WOS:001457048300001,
	abstract = {The electrical energy consumption is increasing day by day to meet
   customer demand in new industries development, electric vehicle
   charging, and railways. The intermittent renewable energy resources are
   integrated in the power grid to meet the increasing demand and to reduce
   greenhouse emissions. Hence, essential strategy is to reduce the power
   consumption of the existing industry with the same productivity to make
   the plant profitable avoiding pollution and global warming. In the
   foundry industries, furnaces are the key equipment that consumes more
   power to melt the iron metal scrap to liquid metal for manufacturing
   castings. To make a foundry profitable, power consumption and worker's
   salary are the important parameters since the cost of energy per unit,
   raw material, and transportation may not be controlled easily by the
   plant. To optimize the energy cost, each industry is purchasing a
   limited maximum demand (MD) power since for each allotted MD values in
   kVA are chargeable whether the maximum limit of the MD is consumed or
   not. If the allotted MD is crossed at any instant of a time over a
   billing cycle, there will be a huge penalty for the utilized over the
   limit in KVA values from the energy supplier. In conventional foundry
   industries, called Industry 3.0, each furnace has separate circuit
   breaker switches and a separate maximum demand controller where the MD
   is set manually based on the expertise suggestions to avoid excess MD
   penalty. When the MD exceeds this limit, the maximum demand controller
   of the respective furnace will trip the corresponding circuit breaker.
   Hence, the furnace that is in production cannot raise the power beyond
   the maximum demand control limit of that furnace though the designed
   capacity of the furnace is high. In the proposed system, if power is not
   utilized by any furnace due to any planned or unplanned stoppage or
   reduction of power due to operation constraints, the unutilized power is
   diverted to another furnace to utilize the allotted maximum demand of
   power in an optimum way within the limit of the allotted MD. In the
   proposed system, PLC and SCADA are used for digital transformation to
   achieve Industry 4.0 standards, collecting the actual power consumption
   data of each furnace and sharing the unutilized power to slave furnaces
   in an optimum way by using LSTM-based PID controller and adaptive fuzzy
   logic controller without crossing the allotted maximum demand of the
   plant and decreases the energy consumption per metric ton of liquid
   metal production by 7.6\%. The conserved electrical energy increases the
   profit of the plant, reduces CO2 emission by 557,568 MT per annum to
   save the world from global warming and pollution, and increases the
   productivity by 7.1\% without affecting the quality of the product.},

   purpose of this study is to review the digital agriculture status in
   five countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and
   Nigeria. The study consisted of a bibliometric analysis using a database
   exported from the web of science through a well-defined search string.
   Additionally, the cases of digital technology deployment in the
   countries were assessed through a systematic review approach comparing
   the technologies used in the target countries. Representative articles
   from the bibliometric review published in the last five years were
   selected for the comparative analysis. The bibliometric analysis based
   on 3,249 publications revealed that the research interests have
   significantly increased since 2014. The top two countries in terms of
   authors' nationality were Nigeria and Ghana, respectively. Climate
   change, Machine Learning (ML) and adoption were the hot topics of
   discussion. The digital agriculture survey showed that publications in
   Nigeria were focused on Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensors
   Networks, blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence (IA) technologies.
   Ghana also has a strong interest in blockchain, AI, and big data, while
   Burkina Faso focused on IoT and AI. Cote d'Ivoire and Benin focused only

	abstract = {Mobile communication providers continuously collect many parameters,
   statistics, and key performance indicators (KPIs) with the goal of
   identifying operation scenarios that can affect the quality of
   Internet-based services. In this regard, anomaly detection and
   classification in mobile networks have become challenging tasks due to
   both the huge number of involved variables and the unknown distributions
   exhibited by input features. This paper introduces an unsupervised
   methodology based on both a data-cleaning strategy and explainable
   machine learning models to detect and classify performance anomalies in
   mobile networks. Specifically, this methodology dubbed explainable
   machine learning for anomaly detection and classification (XMLAD) aims
   at identifying features and operation scenarios characterizing
   performance anomalies without resorting to parameter tuning. To this
   end, this approach includes a data cleaning stage that extracts and
   removes outliers from experiments and features to train the anomaly
   detection engine with the cleanest possible dataset. Moreover, the
   methodology considers the differences between discretized values of the
   target KPI and labels predicted by the anomaly detection engine to build
   the anomaly classification engine which identifies features and
   thresholds that could cause performance anomalies. The proposed
   methodology incorporates two decision tree classifiers to build
   explainable models of anomaly detection and classification engines whose
   decision structures recognize features and thresholds describing both
   normal behaviors and performance anomalies. We evaluate the XMLAD
   methodology on real datasets captured by operational tests in commercial
   networks. In addition, we present a testbed that generates synthetic
   data using a known TCP throughput model to assess the accuracy of the
   proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Background: Hospital staff frequently performs the same process hundreds
   to thousands of times a day. Customizable Internet of Things buttons are
   small, wirelessly-enabled devices that trigger specific actions with the
   press of an integrated button and have the potential to automate some of
   these repetitive tasks. In addition, IoT buttons generate logs of
   triggered events that can be used for future process improvements.
   Although Internet of Things buttons have seen some success as consumer
   products, little has been reported on their application in hospital
   systems.
   Objective: We discuss potential hospital applications categorized by the
   intended user group (patient or hospital staff). In addition, we examine
   key technological considerations, including network connectivity,
   security, and button management systems.
   Methods: In order to meaningfully deploy Internet of Things buttons in a
   hospital system, we propose an implementation framework grounded in the
   Plan-Do-Study-Act method.
   Results: We plan to deploy Internet of Things buttons within our
   hospital system to deliver real-time notifications in public-facing
   tasks such as restroom cleanliness and critical supply restocking. We
   expect results from this pilot in the next year.
   Conclusions: Overall, Internet of Things buttons have significant
   promise; future rigorous evaluations are needed to determine the impact
   of Internet of Things buttons in real-world health care settings.},

	abstract = {Network slicing is a key capability for next generation mobile networks.
   It enables infrastructure providers to cost effectively customize
   logical networks over a shared infrastructure. A critical component of
   network slicing is resource allocation, which needs to ensure that
   slices receive the resources needed to support their services while
   optimizing network efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel
   approach to slice-based resource allocation named Guaranteed seRvice
   Efficient nETwork slicing (GREET). The underlying concept is to set up a
   constrained resource allocation game, where ( \$i\$ ) slices
   unilaterally optimize their allocations to best meet their (dynamic)
   customer loads, while ( \$ii\$ ) constraints are imposed to guarantee
   that, if they wish so, slices receive a pre-agreed share of the network
   resources. The resulting game is a variation of the well-known Fisher
   market, where slices are provided a budget to contend for network
   resources (as in a traditional Fisher market), but (unlike a Fisher
   market) prices are constrained for some resources to ensure that the
   pre-agreed guarantees are met for each slice. In this way, GREET
   combines the advantages of a share-based approach (high efficiency by
   flexible sharing) and reservation-based ones (which provide guarantees
   by assigning a fixed amount of resources). We characterize the Nash
   equilibrium, best response dynamics, and propose a practical slice
   strategy with provable convergence properties. Extensive simulations
   exhibit substantial improvements over network slicing state-of-the-art
   benchmarks.},

   implemented by a small consulting firm, active in a traditional
   industrial context, pursuing the innovation path to develop solutions
   within the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) domain. Design/methodology/approach This
   study undertakes a single qualitative case study of Sinergia, an Italian
   innovative small consulting firm. The case study is analyzed through
   critical events and adopting the 4 R model, developed within the
   industrial marketing and purchasing (IMP) approach. Findings The
   analysis highlights a transition from knowledge broker to solution
   provider, based on a process of networking, with a relevant strategizing
   effort, and of assembling internal, external and shared resources. Three
   patterns in the evolution of the company's innovation path emerge:
   resource-oriented networking, hybrid resource development and resource
   assembly. Originality/value The empirical study provides novel empirical
   evidence over localized innovation processes in I4.0 by exploring the
   innovation path pursued by a small consulting firm in connection with
   the local business. The study represents a theoretical development in
   terms of the 4 R model as it suggests the need to further conceptualize
   the category of technical resources - including products and facilities
   - in the increasingly complex I4.0 domain and provides insights on the
   changing role of actors in networks underpinned by emerging resource

	abstract = {Purpose Being an efficient mechanism for the value of money,
   public-private partnership (PPP) is one of the most prominent approaches
   for infrastructure construction. Hence, many controversies about the
   performance effectiveness of these delivery systems have been debated.
   This research aims to develop a novel performance management perspective
   by revealing the causal effect of key performance indicators (KPIs) on
   PPP infrastructures. Design/methodology/approach The literature review
   was used in this study to extract the PPPs KPIs. Experts' judgment and
   interviews, as well as questionnaires, were designed to obtain data.
   Copula Bayesian network (CBN) has been selected to achieve the research
   purpose. CBN is one of the most potent tools in statistics for analyzing
   the causal relationship of different elements and considering their
   quantitive impact on each other. By utilizing this technique and using
   Python as one of the best programming languages, this research used
   machine learning methods, SHAP and XGBoost, to optimize the network.
   Findings The sensitivity analysis of the KPIs verified the causation
   importance in PPPs performance management. This study determined the
   causal structure of KPIs in PPP projects, assessed each indicator's
   priority to performance, and found 7 of them as a critical cluster to
   optimize the network. These KPIs include innovation for financing,
   feasibility study, macro-environment impact, appropriate financing
   option, risk identification, allocation, sharing, and transfer, finance
   infrastructure, and compliance with the legal and regulatory framework.
   Practical implications Identifying the most scenic indicators helps the
   private sector to allocate the limited resources more rationally and
   concentrate on the most influential parts of the project. It also
   provides the KPIs' critical cluster that should be controlled and
   monitored closely by PPP project managers. Additionally, the public
   sector can evaluate the performance of the private sector more
   accurately. Finally, this research provides a comprehensive causal
   insight into the PPPs' performance management that can be used to
   develop management systems in future research. Originality/value For the
   first time, this research proposes a model to determine the causal
   structure of KPIs in PPPs and indicate the importance of this insight.
   The developed innovative model identifies the KPIs' behavior and takes a
   non-linear approach based on CBN and machine learning methods while
   providing valuable information for construction and performance managers
   to allocate resources more efficiently.},

	abstract = {External knowledge is widely acknowledged to be critical for
   organizational innovation. However, we lack understanding of how
   different sources of knowledge-namely knowledge from customers and
   partners-influence innovation. Grounded in the knowledge-based view of
   the firm, we theoretically develop and empirically test a model of
   mechanisms through which two forms of external knowledge acquisition
   i.e., customer cocreation and partner sourcing, foster knowledge
   creation and innovation. We posit that the different forms of external
   knowledge acquisition contribute differentially toward innovation
   outcomes. Finally, we examine the moderating role of knowledge
   dissemination capability on the relationships between external knowledge
   of both forms. We test our proposed model using data gathered from 655
   organizations in two knowledge intensive sectors i.e., financial and
   information technology. Our model explains 65 \% of the variance in
   knowledge creation and highlights that organizations with higher degree
   of knowledge creation are more likely to innovate through new patents.
   We extend prior research on customer co-creation and organizational
   innovation by identifying intervening organizational variables and
   mechanisms that explicate the effects of external knowledge on
   innovation. The results provide important implications for organizations
   regarding the capabilities needed to utilize external knowledge for
   innovation.},

	abstract = {The digital service market is vast and constantly expanding. In the
   digital service market, platforms such as Netflix, Steam, etc. often
   seek to enter into exclusivity deals with service providers or
   developers in order to get exclusive access rights to their digital
   services in the hopes that offering exclusive access to a digital
   product will entice new consumers to use their platform and thus
   generate increased profits. In this study we focus on this phenomenon in
   the mobile gaming market. For example, the game developer Electronic
   Arts agreed to offer Apple iOS a 4-month exclusive deal for the
   well-known mobile game Plants vs. Zombies 2. The benefits of exclusivity
   deals for both platforms and digital service developers are unclear and
   have not been studied in the extant literature. We develop an analytical
   model of digital service profits to examine the optimal conditions of
   exclusivity for platforms and digital service developers. Our result
   shows that platforms prefer exclusivity while developers prefer offering
   their product on multiple platforms. We further explore the strategies
   that platforms and digital service developers can employ by analyzing
   three simultaneous and sequential game pricing and release scenarios. We
   find that higher profits can be generated by whichever party determines
   the price of a game first. However, we also found that in the presence
   of a leasing fee, platforms may prefer a simultaneous pricing and
   release scenario to even a platform-led pricing and release scenario. We
   conclude with implications for research and practice and suggestions for
   future research.},

	abstract = {The construction industry, business models, and smart cities are
   recognized as pivotal domains with profound implications for fostering
   sustainability, prompting extensive research endeavors. However, there
   remains a dearth of interdisciplinary integration within this sphere
   aimed at fostering sustainable development. Nevertheless, current
   studies suggest that research in this area could provide theoretical and
   practical guidance for the sustainable transformation of society and
   make a positive contribution to the realization of the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). Therefore, this paper aims to utilize an
   innovative mixed research approach combining macro-quantitative
   bibliometric analysis with subsequent micro-qualitative content
   examination based on the SDGs to explore the relationship between BIM
   and smart cities in promoting a sustainability-oriented business model,
   which provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall situation
   and development of research topics in the field and contributes to the
   improvement of the SDGs. The results show that, during the last 13 years
   (from the year 2011 to 2023), the period from the year 2011 to 2016 was
   the initial stage of the field, followed by a rapid growth after the
   year 2018, of which ``BIM{''}, ``Smart City{''}, ``Business Model{''},
   ``Building Life Cycle{''}, ``Urban Management{''}, and ``Business Model
   Innovation{''} are the keywords representing the current research
   hotspots. The circular economy model that has been developed since 2021
   has contributed to life cycle stages, including ``briefing stages{''}
   and ``procurement stages{''}. As such, the ``whole life cycle{''},
   ``strategic urban planning frameworks{''}, and ``sustainable business
   models{''} have become future research trends, whilst real-world
   applications such as ``smart tourism{''}, ``e-government{''}, and
   ``green building{''} have emerged. Further, the key partnerships of
   ``city managers{''}, ``corporate enterprises{''}, and ``public
   participation{''} for smart cities contribute to the achievement of SDGs
   8 and 17 in terms of integrating urban information technology and urban
   infrastructure, policy regulation, knowledge-sharing, improving economic
   efficiency, and promoting sustainable economic growth.},

	abstract = {In an era characterized by the rapid flow of innovation resources in a
   globally interconnected economy, the concept of innovation ecosystems
   has gained prominence. This research paper, titled ``Exploring the
   Dynamics of Graduate Students Breakthrough Innovation Ecosystems in
   ``Necklace{''} Technology: A Game-Theoretical Approach,{''} delves into
   the transformative role of graduate students in fostering national
   independent innovation, particularly in the realm of ``necklace{''}
   technology. It investigates the intricate interplay among knowledge
   suppliers, demanders, and learning platforms within the tailored
   breakthrough innovation ecosystem for postgraduates. Drawing upon game
   theory, the study constructs an evolutionary game model to unravel the
   dynamics of value co-creation within this ecosystem. The research aims
   to understand how these elements influence the system's evolution toward
   an optimal stable state, emphasizing the transformative impact of
   additional benefits from the knowledge platform and potential advantages
   from the knowledge supply side. The findings provide theoretical
   insights into the complex relationships among knowledge providers,
   demanders, and platforms, shedding light on the conditions that shape
   the ideal state of the ecosystem. Furthermore, the paper offers valuable
   managerial implications for stakeholders in graduate education and
   policymaking. It highlights the central role of knowledge platforms and
   the need for incentives to encourage knowledge transfer and
   collaboration. Policymakers can leverage these insights to promote
   digital technology integration and collaborative knowledge creation
   among diverse stakeholders, ultimately enhancing the efficacy of
   innovation ecosystems in graduate education. This research contributes
   to the ongoing discourse on knowledge innovation within the context of
   graduate education, aligning with contemporary trends in online teaching
   paradigms and transformative value propositions. It not only enriches
   theoretical foundations but also provides actionable recommendations for
   practitioners and policymakers in the field of innovation ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Organizations seeking to create innovative environments in health care
   need to pay attention to a number of factors. These include making
   available sufficient resources, notably money and physical space, but
   also coordination and consultation regarding intellectual property and
   licensing; enabling access to engineers, software developers, and
   behavioral scientists; making providers and patients available to
   innovators; having a sufficiently long-term view; and insulating the
   innovation group from operational demands. If there is a single
   essential key to success, it is making innovation a strategic priority.
   Academic health systems are enormous generators of innovation in the
   form of generalizable research in biomedical sciences. Typically, much
   of that innovation is externally supported, and little is directed to
   improving care processes internally. In industries other than health
   care, organizations invest their own funds in research and development
   to promote innovation, and this investment is seen as a metric for a
   firm's commitment to its future. Increased investment in care-process
   innovation is long overdue.},

	abstract = {PurposeThe dynamic business environment and intense competition have
   mandated agility in operations for manufacturing firms. Effective
   inter-organizational collaboration can make operations more agile. This
   paper develops an interpretive model to explore the effect of supply
   chain collaboration (SCC) on supply chain agility (SCA) and,
   subsequently, on business performance.Design/methodology/approachA
   hierarchical model that illustrates the relationship between SCC, SCA
   and firm performance components is developed using total interpretative
   structural modeling (TISM). Also, statistical validation of the model
   has been performed.FindingsThe results indicate that the vision and
   alertness of the firm on the strategic front promote collaboration
   between supply chain partners. This creates operational agility, helping
   the firm to absorb fluctuations in demand, thereby enhancing business
   performance.Research limitations/implicationsThe opinion of most
   respondents was considered to develop the TISM framework over the fuzzy
   one, which necessitates a significantly more extensive data set.
   However, multiple discussions with participants can eliminate the
   prejudice of the majority approach. Also, the paper's development and
   validation were restricted to Indian manufacturing small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The model can potentially be evaluated
   in large organizations to provide further insights.Originality/valueThe
   study blends the factors of SCC and SCA in a novel way to explain their
   combined impact on business performance. The TISM model addresses the
   ``why{''} of theory development in addition to the ``what{''} and
   ``how{''} of it. Using triangulation in combination with the
   interpretative tool, this study additionally offers methodological
   value.},

	abstract = {Despite the criticality of a healthy partnership between CEOs and CIOs
   in organizations for effective business-IT alignment, we still know
   little about how crucial yet under researched facets of mutual
   understanding compare between CEOs and CIOs and how their ability of
   mutual perspective-taking affects the quality of collaboration in their
   partnership. Drawing on two established theoretical models in social and
   personal relationship research, the perceptual congruence model (PCM)
   and the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM), our study examines
   102 matched-pair survey responses of CEOs and CIOs using dyadic data
   analysis. Our findings show that both executives' actual opinions on
   important business and IT topics are more similar than both perceive
   them to be. Accordingly, perceptions of each other's opinions are
   negatively biased away from their real opinions. Moreover, our study
   demonstrates that CIO5' understanding of their CEO plays a more pivotal
   role in predicting the quality of CEO-CIO collaboration than CEOs'
   understanding of their CIO; this highlights the disparate importance of
   an active and passive role of understanding in the CEO-CIO partnership.

   theory to explain how these firms innovate their business models as a
   cognitive description of the structure and activities. We conducted 24

   Focusing on the opportunity side of changes, taking action, learning
   from the results of each action, and collaboration with important
   stakeholders are the most important factors in successful entry into a
   frontier market. Also, technology and human capital play an important
   part in taking control of the frontier market entry process. We

	abstract = {Technological artifacts designed by individuals from developing nations
   often do not flourish in developing regions. Many authors conducting
   work in these regions have therefore called on researchers to make use
   of co-design in order to mitigate power imbalances, include the voices
   of communities in the design of technology intended for them, and design
   and build more contextually situated technology. Many of these authors
   also refer to the need for co-design readiness in their work. However,
   little is known about how co-design readiness can be articulated and
   achieved, especially when working with rural communities. In this paper,
   we make use of qualitative meta-analysis to interrogate the data from
   three distinct case studies in order to investigate co-design readiness.
   We found that co-design readiness comprises three forms, namely: (1)
   emotional readiness built through trust, relationship building, and
   empathy; (2) cultural readiness, which requires that researchers and
   participants have an awareness and respect for each other's cultural
   values and beliefs; and, finally, (3) readiness in terms of confidence
   and familiarity with the technologies used which can be achieved through
   careful and strategic methodological decisions. We found that
   researchers should explicitly plan for readiness and should not assume
   that readiness will grow organically and that co-design, if planned well
   is a lengthy process. Finally, we provide learnings from our work to how
   co-design readiness can be achieved through planning and methodological
   decisions.},

	abstract = {Identifying influential nodes within complex networks holds significant
   importance for enhancing network resilience and understanding
   vulnerabilities, thereby providing insights for both theoretical
   exploration and practical applications. Understanding how quickly
   information spreads highlights the need to identify influential nodes
   promptly. Certain global centrality measures, including betweenness
   (BC), closeness (CC), eigenvector (EC), katz centrality, and coreness
   score (CR), fail to recognize influential nodes situated near the
   periphery of the network and those with direct connections to the target
   node. In response to these challenges and to enhance the influence of
   identification, we have developed a comprehensive framework, namely ISC
   , grounded in isolating coefficient, encompassing both a node's direct
   connections and those of its neighbors. Using the proposed approach, we
   defined six new centrality measures, including isolating katz centrality
   (ISKC), isolating coreness centrality (ISCR), isolating eigenvector
   centrality (ISEC), isolating betweenness centrality (ISBC), isolating
   closeness centrality (ISCC), and isolating clustering coefficient
   centrality (ISCL). Through comparative analysis across five real-world
   networks, ISC is evaluated alongside existing centrality measures,
   confirming its effectiveness in identifying influential nodes while
   maintaining reasonable computational efficiency. The experimental
   results affirm that ISC outperforms other centrality measures in
   locating influential nodes within complex networks. Additionally, we
   evaluate the similarity between our proposed methods and both
   conventional and recent measures by assessing rank correlations using
   Kendall's tau coefficient. The simulation outcomes indicate that one of
   the proposed methods ISCR, utilizing a lower-complexity algorithm,
   effectively identifies the most influential nodes with high accuracy.
   Furthermore, statistical techniques were employed to evaluate the
   proposed methods, demonstrating high reliability and precision in
   predicting influential nodes across various datasets, as indicated by
   low standard deviations and narrow confidence intervals.},

	abstract = {Quality inspection, a widely adopted practice in supply chains, measures
   whether delivered products conform to prespecified quality requirements.
   Due to potential economic benefits, suppliers may deliberately
   manipulate products to falsify test results. However, unqualified
   products could cause severe problems in supply chains or even tragedies,
   such as China's tainted milk scandal. In this paper, we propose a
   belief-desire-intention modeling approach to predict suppliers' behavior
   and provide inspection suggestions to buyers to overcome the problem.
   Assuming access to the production process, our approach can represent
   suppliers' knowledge of production and deception to mimic their
   reasoning processes and predict their deception intentions. This
   flexible approach can also adapt to environmental changes and deliver
   effective results. In this paper, we build a prototype system for supply
   chain quality inspections based on the proposed method. We conduct
   laboratory experiments to collect data for computational assessments of
   the performance of the prototype. It is shown that our proposed approach
   is more accurate than classic machine learning methods in detecting

@article{WOS:001115584200001,
	abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and energy communities have garnered
   much attention over in recent years due to increasing investments in
   local energy generation and storage assets. Much research has been
   performed on the mechanisms and methodologies behind their
   implementation and realisation. However, the efficiency to be gained
   from P2P trading, and the structure of local energy markets raise many
   important challenges. To analyse the efficiency of P2P energy markets,
   in this work, we consider two different popular approaches to
   peer-to-peer trading: centralised (through a central market
   maker/clearing entity) vs. fully decentralised (P2P), and explore the
   comparative economic benefits of these models. We focus on the metric of
   Gains from Trade (GT), given optimal P2P trading schedule computed by a
   schedule optimiser. In both local market models, benefits from trading
   are realised mainly due to the diversity in consumption behaviour and
   renewable energy generation between prosumers in an energy community.
   Both market models will lead to the most promising P2P contracts (the
   ones with the highest Gains from Trade) to be established first. Yet, we
   find diversity decreases quickly as more peer-to-peer energy contracts
   are established and more prosumers join the market, leading to
   significantly diminishing returns. In this work, we aim to quantify this
   effect using real-world data from two large-scale smart energy trials in
   the UK, i.e. the Low Carbon London project and the Thames Valley Vision
   project. Our experimental study shows that, for both market models, only
   a small number of P2P contracts i.e. less than 10\% of the possible P2P
   contracts are required to achieve the majority of the maximal potential
   Gains from Trade. Similarly, only a fraction of prosumers are required
   to participate in energy trading to realise significant GT; namely we
   found that 60\% of the maximal GT can be realised with only 30\% of
   prosumers' participation, with the percentage of maximal GT reaching
   80\% when participation increases to 50\% of prosumers. Finally, we
   study the effect that diversity in consumption profiles has on overall
   trading potential and dynamics in an energy community. We show that in a
   community with a DF(load diversity factor) = 1, 80\% of potential
   maximal GT can be achieved by 10\% of prosumers engaging in P2P trading,
   while in a community with DF = 1.5, it is beneficial for 40\% of the
   prosumers to trade.},

	abstract = {Incumbent companies across industries such as banking, insurance, and
   enterprise software have begun transforming their existing product
   platform ecosystems into innovation platforms ecosystems to increase
   generativity in their ecosystems. Such ecosystem transformations not
   only entail technological challenges as the underlying platform
   technology changes but also organizational challenges in that ecosystem
   actors such as partners and customers need to become part of the
   transformed ecosystem. To study how incumbent companies can govern
   ecosystem transformations successfully, we interpret ecosystems as
   organizational fields and ecosystem transformations as changes to the
   fields' institutional infrastructure. Based on a multiyear, grounded
   theory study of the transformation of SAP's on- premises ERP system, we
   first identify institutionalization challenges that arise when
   institutional infrastructure is changed during an ecosystem
   transformation. We then show how field- level governance mechanisms
   address these challenges and how the new institutional infrastructure
   gains legitimacy among ecosystem actors, ultimately leading to the
   institutionalization of the transformed ecosystem. These findings
   contribute to the literature on ecosystem transformations and platform
   governance by highlighting the role that institutional forces play in
   ecosystem transformations. Furthermore, we add to the literature on
   institutional theory by providing insights into the dynamics of
   institutional infrastructure as it becomes infused with digital
   technologies.},

	abstract = {Accelerated by the pandemic, fashion online marketplace platforms have
   advanced rapidly in recent years, and some of them have started
   incorporating virtual fitting technology (e.g. mobile body
   scanning/measuring technology) into their platforms to enhance the
   customer experience. Previous research on virtual fitting technology and
   the use of the online fashion marketplace has mainly focused on customer
   perspectives. This paper aims to bridge the gap in research related to
   the vendor perspectives (i.e. fashion small and medium enterprises
   (SMEs)) with regard to incorporate mobile body measuring technology in
   online marketplace platforms by interviewing (n = 45) owners and workers
   of fashion SMEs in Hong Kong and China. Their perceptions and concerns
   are revealed and further elaborated through qualitative analysis. Our
   findings suggest that fashion SMEs acknowledge the efficiency of using
   the online marketplace and the advantages of collecting customer data
   and feedback as well as drawing insights from which, while they express
   concerns about competition and the potential for abuse of return and
   refund policies. In addition, they ascertain that mobile body measuring
   technology is cost-effective for remote customisation orders. However,
   technical adoption and accuracy are the major concerns. To incorporate
   mobile measuring technology into fashion online marketplace platforms,
   respondents regard the technology can complement existing customer data
   to address sizing issues. However, they are uncertain about its
   effectiveness in reducing return rate. It is also suggested that the
   technology should be capable of capturing customers' body shape and
   special body features (e.g. hunchback), and incorporating virtual
   fitting assistant with clear instructions and guidance can improve
   customer experience and minimize fitting errors.},

	abstract = {Service transformation calls for a revolutionary strategic mindset
   within service firms. Service firms aspire to achieve a distinctive
   vision through service transformation, often engaging technology and
   digitalization as critical partners in creating long-term firm success
   in the market by nurturing enhanced customer and stakeholder benefits.
   Therefore, it is imperative for us to examine, understand, and seek ways
   in which transformation can be utilized effectively by service firms. A
   new conceptualization is proposed that highlights how service
   transformation can follow many strategic paths, ranging from a
   relatively minor linear evolutionary reformation of service offerings to
   a cyclical and ongoing complete creative destruction and reincarnation
   of the firm. This manuscript first proposes an organizing framework to
   understand the internal and external factors that have the potential to
   render service transformation achievable, as well as the range of
   internal and external outcomes that can result from successful
   transformation. We then draw upon theories of evolution to delineate the
   process of transformation over time in service contexts, resulting in a
   conceptual model of service transformation that articulates three viable
   pathways to service transformation, which we call the ``3Rs of Service
   Transformation{''} - reformation, renovation, and reincarnation. We
   define and provide examples of these three paths of service
   transformation and identify situations and contexts in which each
   approach may be most appropriate for certain firms. We conclude with a
   discussion of future research directions.},

	abstract = {As software products increasingly become part of larger ecosystems,
   research and development (R\&D) units of software producers organize
   themselves around projects to become more responsive to the environment.
   Organizations participating in software ecosystems must continuously
   adapt and adjust their software development and maintenance processes to
   drive both medium-term and long-term innovation. Agile methods and
   practices are widely adopted to guide the collaboration within and
   between project teams in software development. Moreover, when
   successfully attained, agility can drive innovation by enabling software
   development organizations to cope with technological changes and exploit
   emerging opportunities in software ecosystems. In this article, we focus
   on how organizations attain agility in the maintenance and development
   of software products. To answer this question, we conduct a longitudinal
   case study of Agile Scrum implementation in the R\&D unit of a major
   supplier of telecommunication equipment. We investigate the emerging
   tensions and highlight practices used to balance these tensions in the
   Agile Scrum implementation. We identify four capabilities and ten

   processes automation at a shared services center (SSC).
   Design/methodology/approachA single-entity survey was carried out at an
   SSC provider of B2B accounting services of a multinational company in
   the electrical sector, and structural equation modeling was applied for
   data analysis. FindingsThe results show that the culture for innovation,
   the work engagement and the use of interactive PMS positively and
   significantly influence the accounting process automation in the
   investigated SSC. Moreover, the use of interactive PMS presents a
   mediating effect on the relationship between culture for innovation and
   work engagement. Research limitations/implicationsThe research findings
   contribute by revealing that the culture of innovation, work engagement
   and the interactive PMS support the use of robotic process automation
   and artificial intelligence in the interorganizational automation of
   accounting processes in an SSC-type service ecosystem. This highlights
   the importance of the culture of innovation and the positive feeling
   toward work being reinforced by the organization and the role of the
   interactive PMS as a formal instrument to transmit the organizational
   objectives and provide a common vision. Originality/valueThe study
   reveals that the use of interactive PMS seems to be an important
   conductor of the behavior of employees toward the accounting process
   automation strategy at the SSC, reinforced, in this case, by the culture
   of innovation and work engagement.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to quantify the innovation ecosystem model for allowing
   the development of smart products at the country level. In this regard,
   the research used an empirical approach to scale and validate the six
   dimensions of an innovation ecosystem model among the small and
   medium-sized enterprises of 21 European countries. The quantitative
   methods of panel data analysis and Pearson correlation tests between
   variables of the innovation ecosystem and smart products were considered
   to examine six research hypotheses. Three dimensions of the innovation
   ecosystem model, i.e., configuration, change, and capability, have
   enough effects to accelerate high levels of smart products in the small
   and medium-sized enterprises of European countries, supporting the
   external and internal economic partnerships of institutions and
   companies, cultural changes in functional status, and knowledge-based
   capabilities of technological skills in each ecosystem. In addition,
   hierarchical clustering analysis for the classification of the countries
   showed that some countries, e.g., the United Kingdom, Netherlands,
   Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, France, and Norway, could support
   their powerful smart products for small and medium-sized enterprises at
   the national level due to their high mean innovation ecosystem values.
   Overall, the research can describe the managerial implications regarding
   the knowledge-based capabilities of the technological skills in each
   ecosystem to be utilized by managers and stakeholders in small and
   medium-sized enterprises.},

	abstract = {Does exporting intermediate goods induce learning from importers? In
   this paper, we examine to what extent learning from German industries
   can be explained by knowledge spillovers, channeled through the export
   of intermediate goods. Our study is based on a sample of 27 German trade
   partners in 14 manufacturing industries for the period 2004-2016. Using
   data on patent citations and trading in intermediate goods, we find
   support for the widely known ``learning-by-exporting{''} hypothesis. Our
   analyses reveal that citations to German patents are positively related
   to exported intermediate goods weighted by German R\&D expenditure. The
   relationship between these spillovers and learning seems to be
   particularly strong in certain industries. We also show that the level
   of absorptive capacity of the exporting industry-country plays a
   positive role in mediating these spillovers.},

	abstract = {Despite the crucial role of creativity in the dynamic and intricate
   practice of Information Systems Development (ISD), our understanding of
   its emergence in ISD teams is limited. Prior research has focused on
   isolated interventions into the people, structure, task, and technology
   components of ISD practices. However, the synergistic interactions
   between these components are often overlooked, resulting in
   interventions that may be ineffective or counterproductive. Drawing on
   Leavitt's Socio-Technical Systems (STS) theory, this paper explores
   creativity as a synergistic outcome of interactions within and between
   the people, structure, task, and technology components. Our qualitative
   study at a multinational banking software provider reveals that
   creativity emerged from within-component interactions when innovators
   and facilitators in ISD teams interact empathetically during idea
   generation and evaluation, visualize ideas using technologies for
   representation and collaboration, and align their creative styles with
   the organization's formal and informal structures. Additionally, we
   found that interactions between the STS components in ISD team practices
   created stimulating environments for creativity to emerge. Our study
   advances an STS perspective on the emergence of creativity in ISD teams,
   emphasizing synergistic interactions between people, structure, task,
   and technology rather than isolated interventions. Practically, our
   findings provide insights into how IS professionals can nurture
   creativity by fostering empathetic leadership, aligning creative styles
   with organizational structures, and balancing tensions between control

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information and communication technology,
   data empowerment has become an important way for platform service supply
   chain (PSSC) members to obtain a competitive advantage. Based on the
   three-level PSSC network structure composed of service providers,
   platform operators, and demand markets, this paper assumes that platform
   operators empower service providers to improve service quality, and PSSC
   members invest in data security risk control. Then, using variational
   inequality and equilibrium theory, a supply chain network equilibrium
   model considering data empowerment is constructed, and the equilibrium
   conditions of the whole network are obtained. Based on numerical
   examples, this paper analyzes the impact of the sensitivity of the
   demand market to service quality, the relative importance of service
   providers' service quality improvement level, the data empowerment cost
   of PSSC members, and the data security risk control investment of PSSC
   members on the equilibrium state of the supply chain network. The
   results show the following: because the service quality is produced by
   the cooperation between service providers and platform operators,
   platform operators may have free-riding behavior and are only willing to
   invest a fixed data empowerment cost to ensure the essential service
   quality; data security risk control investment is an important factor
   affecting service sales; and when supply chain network members reduce
   data security risk control investment, consumers' willingness to pay for
   services will be reduced, resulting in a decline in the overall profit
   of the supply chain network.},

@article{WOS:001269859800001,
	abstract = {Advances in communications technology have had tremendous influence on
   network implementation to date, and as communication devices get smaller
   and technologies more intelligent, a great number of solutions are
   emerging that converge communications with a multitude of domains. In
   particular, as transportation modes assisting with mobility have
   developed, many studies are in the pipeline on the domain of mobility.
   The development of mobility services has prompted the spread of car
   sharing, which also highlights the need for a system that controls
   shared vehicles. The data of such control system can be used not only
   for the operational management of vehicles but also the management of
   users in terms of user driving analysis or monitoring safe driving. In
   addition, it can be utilized in a variety of other applications that
   analyze traffic flow based on vehicle driving data, determine required
   vehicle maintenance intervals, or schedule vehicle maintenance in
   advance. However, if forged/altered by a third party, control data might
   pose a lot of challenges to data utilization. This study proposes a
   mechanism that manages control data on a blockchain to enhance the
   integrity of control data created in the communications process. In this
   paper, we propose a mechanism for applying a blockchain to the
   communication process between clients and servers. In the proposed
   mechanism, platform operators generate and provide independent
   identification information and identification numbers for users. The
   identification information and identification numbers are used to prove
   that the generated blocks were created by specific users. Data generated
   by clients create a block with a hash including user identification
   information alongside the user identification number. Verification of
   the generated block is performed on the platform vendor's server,
   validating that the user identification number in the block matches the
   server-side user identification information and the hash of the data
   within the block. Thus, even when the contents of the block are shared
   in a public blockchain environment, user identification information is
   only held by the server and clients, preventing third parties from
   impersonating specific users to create data blocks. Furthermore, the
   verification process of the data includes hashes received from other
   nearby vehicles, preventing data tampering by the block creator.},

	abstract = {Over recent decades, many platform-native start-ups and firms were
   founded and some are now among the world's most valuable. This study,
   however, focuses on an incumbent firm transitioning from a long
   established product platform ecosystem to an innovation platform
   ecosystem in response to the platform-natives' threats of disruption. We
   specifically investigate the dynamic capabilities needed by the
   incumbent firm in an enterprise software ecosystem in the transition
   phase. Our analysis builds on multi-perspective empirical data covering
   the viewpoints of all the actor types in the ecosystem, i.e., platform
   owner, platform partners, and end-user firms. The results imply the
   necessity of four dynamic capabilities: resource curation, ecosystem
   preservation, resource reconfiguration, and ecosystem diversification.
   With this study, we contribute to the emerging literature on the
   incumbent firms' transition to a new ecosystem organising logic, and
   extend the study of dynamic capabilities specifically for the case of
   transitioning to innovation platform ecosystems.},

	abstract = {As physical products are increasingly augmented with digital technology,
   manufacturing firms have become part of the development of so-called
   smart products and smart services. As such, manufacturing firms are
   challenged by new market participants and ecosystem partners,
   particularly from the software development industry, and by the dynamic
   nature of business relationships. While the academic literature on the
   distinctive characteristics of ecosystems, particularly digital
   ecosystems, is rich, the effect of smart service ecosystems' emergence
   on the foundation of smart products remains uncertain. This study
   reports on case study research based on 47 semi-structured interviews
   with four companies that participate in an industrial smart service
   ecosystem. Taking an affordance-theoretic perspective, we uncover the
   antecedents of and the process of emergent smart service ecosystems. We
   find that smart service ecosystems have three socio-technical
   antecedents: a shared worldview, structural flexibility and integrity,
   and architecture of participation. We explain the emergence of smart
   service ecosystems as the result of specialisation in shared affordances
   and integration of idiosyncratic affordances into collective
   affordances. We derive seven propositions regarding the emergence of
   smart services, outline opportunities for further research, and present
   practical guidelines for manufacturing firms.},

	abstract = {This study explores the orchestration of hackathons targeting the
   creation of new ideas and innovation. We employed a qualitative case
   study approach with data collected from hackathon organizers, partners,
   and solvers at multiple events organized by Ultrahack, a Finnish
   hackathon organizer. We initially conceptualized hackathon orchestration
   as a form of coordination that requires brokering in social networks.
   Building on this background, we empirically identify three types of
   orchestration mechanisms: orchestration as relational brokering,
   orchestration as contextual configuring, and orchestration as legitimacy
   building. We analyse how these mechanisms contribute to the benefits
   perceived by hackathon solvers and partners. Our study contributes to
   the academic discourse on orchestration mechanisms in hackathons and
   offers insights for practitioners managing hackathons and innovation
   contests, especially from the point of view of third-party

	abstract = {Healthcare 3D printing (3DP) is in nascent stage and some service
   providers are facilitating its adoption across hospitals in the world.
   There is limited research on healthcare 3DP services, the business
   models of such service providers, the value they provide to the surgeons
   and the hospitals and the co-creation process needed to deliver such
   service innovation. The objective of this research is to identify the
   value proposition, value creation, value capture and value provided to
   users by the healthcare 3DP service providers and to identify the
   resources and capabilities needed by the healthcare 3DP service
   providers and the clinical team to co-create value. Interviews are
   conducted with seven healthcare 3DP service providers, three surgeons,
   and a healthcare 3DP design expert along with secondary data collected
   from the service providers to answer the research questions. The results
   show that healthcare 3DP service providers utilise their exploitative
   capabilities while the surgeons used both explorative and exploitative
   capabilities to engage in the co-creation process and to create
   perceived value for patients. The findings also show that integrated
   healthcare 3DP service providers by providing knowledge, expertise,
   insights and training to the surgical teams are better suited to improve
   the absorptive capacity of hospitals to adopt 3D Printing than
   specialised implant developers.},

	abstract = {Firms generate innovations to profit from market opportunities, which
   are newly identified customer needs not yet being met in the market. The
   rising complexity of market opportunities requires collaboration among
   multiple partner firms. However, this multipartner collaboration
   increases transaction and production costs when generating innovations.
   To address these challenges, incumbents build B2B innovation platforms
   with mechanisms to reduce partners' transaction and production costs. We
   do not yet know if and when partners would choose to use the incumbent's
   traditional service innovation model or the B2B innovation platform and
   how this choice would affect the generativity and profitability of
   innovations for the incumbent and the partners. We used agent-based
   modeling and simulation to develop a theory to address these questions.
   We found that the complexity of market opportunities interacts with the
   B2B innovation platform's transaction andproduction mechanisms to
   jointly affect whether partners use the platform and when the incumbent
   and partners achieve generativity and profitability. When the complexity
   of market opportunities is low, partners use the traditional service
   innovation model. As complexity increases to medium or high levels,
   partners begin to use the B2B innovation platform mechanisms to address
   the transaction and production challenges presented by the complexity of
   market opportunities. However, there are limits to how much the platform
   mechanisms can address these challenges. The complexity of market
   opportunities inhibits the emergence of network effects on B2B
   innovation platforms and limits the generativity and profitability of
   platform partners. There are diminishing benefits of investing in the
   platform's transaction and production mechanisms, and complexity affects
   whether the platform owner or the partners profit from innovations
   generated on the platform.},

   this paper established a positivist quantitative-empirical study to
   bridge the research gap and assess the precursors for a continuance of
   cloud technology in HEIs. Subsequently, this study developed a
   conceptual framework by integrating the IS success model and the IS
   discontinuance model through the lens of the TOE framework. The data
   were collected from the decision-makers of Malaysian HEIs that have
   adopted CC services, and analyzed using Structural equation Modelling
   (SEM) based on Partial Least Squares (PLS). The results indicate that
   the continuance intention can be predicted by technology,
   organizational, environmental, and other contextualized factors,
   explaining 85.2\% of the dependent variables' variance. The paper closes
   with a discussion of the research limitations, contribution, and future
   directions.},

   moderating effect of green open innovation (GOI) that firms need to
   achieve triple bottom line (TBL) performance in the Belt and Road
   Initiative (BRI). This study explores the structure of business
   ecosystems that firms need to achieve sustainable performance and
   investigates open innovations that can be promoted based on them. The
   data used in the analysis was collected from 474 manufacturing firms
   pursuing partnerships among ecosystem participants to promote
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the BRI. The moderating
   regression analysis is used in this study. We found that digitization
   capabilities (DCs) have a significant effect on a firm's TBL
   performance. In addition, it was confirmed that GOI has a positive
   moderating effect on digitalization capabilities and a firm's economic
   performance. Based on these results, we also believe our model
   contributes to the current knowledge by filling several research gaps,
   and our findings offer valuable and practical implications not only for
   achieving sustainable growth but also for the creation of competitive

	abstract = {Dynamic capabilities allow firms to adapt to rapidly changing
   environments, such as digital business ecosystems (DBEs) based on
   emerging technologies. Here, non-focal firms face specific challenges,
   since they have little leverage over the ecosystems in which they
   operate. In the case of the metaverse - which can be conceptualised as a
   series of emerging-technology-based DBEs - dynamic sensing capabilities
   (DSCs) are particularly important for grasping this potentially vast
   albeit vague opportunity.Our explorative study of 14 virtual reality
   companies operating in Germany operationalises the microfoundations of
   these DSCs. Based on 25 interviews with commercial and technical top
   management executives, we introduce taxonomic differentiation and
   explore the impact of size/resource base and business model/market type
   (B2B/B2C) on DSCs.We find that productive opportunism and bricolage
   behaviour allow non-focal firms to navigate the sheer complexity of the
   environment. Social screening helps to unlock tacit knowledge as do
   knowledge-creating routines such as technical experimentation and
   co-creation (with customers, suppliers and even
   competitors).Furthermore, our findings enlarge the understanding of DBEs
   as not horizontally competing but as being organised in a
   downstream-upstream relationship. Moreover, we find that (commercially
   oriented) opportunity screening is closely and crucially linked with
   dynamic seizing capabilities (e.g. customer-driven prototyping and
   business model development).},

   under pressure to balance routine operations and prepare for adverse
   events. Consequently, this research investigates how artificial
   intelligence is used to enable resilience among supply
   chains.Design/methodology/approachThis study first analyzed the
   relationship among different characteristics of AI-enabled supply chain
   and how these elements take it towards resilience by collecting the
   responses from 27 supply chain professionals. Furthermore, to validate
   the results, an empirical analysis is conducted where the responses from
   231 supply chain professionals are collected.FindingsFindings indicate
   that the disruption impact of an event depends on the degree of
   transparency kept and provided to all supply chain partners. This is
   further validated through empirical study, where the impact of
   transparency facilitates the mass customization of the procurement
   strategy to Last Mile Delivery to reduce the impact of disruption.
   Hence, AI facilitates resilience in the supply
   chain.Originality/valueThis study adds to the domain of supply chain and
   information systems management by identifying the driving and dependent
   elements that AI facilitates and further validating the findings and
   structure of the elements through empirical analysis. The research also

	abstract = {Significant advancements within the fields of digitalization,
   electrification, and automation have enabled the development, testing,
   and implementation of increasingly advanced autonomous solutions.
   Current examples of industrial automation promise significant economic
   and sustainability-oriented benefits for industrial customers. Yet,
   implemented autonomous solutions have rarely advanced beyond `islands of
   autonomy'. Although enabling initial improvements in the efficiency and
   effectiveness of operations, they have not led to the systemic process
   improvements that fully integrated site-wide solutions can achieve. It
   is becoming increasingly clear that the major challenges in this shift
   extend beyond technology to focus on business transformation and
   ecosystem relationships. Yet, extant research offers few insights into
   these domains. There is a need to develop a business-focused maturity
   framework for autonomous solutions to contribute to a predominantly
   technical discourse and support equipment actors and their wider
   ecosystems in commercializing autonomous solutions. Thus, the purpose of
   this paper is to investigate how industrial equipment manufacturers can
   align the development of technology, business models and ecosystem
   relationships for the advancement of autonomous solutions. We build on
   case studies that include 32 interviews from four industrial equipment
   manufacturers and their extended ecosystems of customers and partners.
   We capture our findings in a three-level maturity framework for
   industrial autonomous solutions. This framework unwraps the attributes
   of each level from the perspectives of technical system development,
   ecosystem configuration, and business model design and is complemented
   by three overarching principles for the successful commercialization of
   autonomous solutions.},

	abstract = {Open Social Innovation (OSI) involves the collaboration of multiple
   stakeholders to generate ideas, and develop and scale solutions to make
   progress on societal challenges. In an OSI project, stakeholders share
   data and information, utilize it to better understand a problem, and
   combine data with digital technologies to create digitally-enabled
   solutions. Consequently, data gover-nance is essential for orchestrating
   an OSI project to facilitate the coordination of innovation. Because OSI
   brings multiple stakeholders together, and each stakeholder participates
   voluntarily, data governance in OSI has a distributed nature. In this
   essay we put forward a framework consisting of three dimensions allowing
   an inquiry into the effectiveness of such distributed data governance:
   (1) openness (i.e., freely sharing data and information), (2)
   accountability (i.e., willingness to be held responsible and provide
   justifications for one's conduct) and (3) power (i.e., resourceful
   actors' ability to impact other stakeholder's actions). We apply this
   framework to reflect on the OSI project \#WirVsVirus ({''}We versus
   virus{''} in English), to illustrate the challenges in organizing
   effective distributed data governance, and derive implications for

	abstract = {Demanding, competitive business dynamics drive organisations to
   continually evaluate and adopt automation in their structural setups,
   particularly warehouses, for growth and profitability. Industry 4.0
   technologies are revolutionising warehouse operations, resulting in cost
   savings, increased efficiency, and a more environmentally friendly
   approach for businesses. The readiness of organisations to adopt these
   technologies is evaluated with the help of hard and soft determinants
   selected through a theoretical framework of
   Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE). In this study, a unique
   method is used that combines the Modified Delphi method, content
   validity for scale validation, expert opinion consensus tests for
   agreement, ranking determinants using the Best Worst Method (BWM), and
   rank validation through sensitivity analysis for warehousing industry
   experts and organisations. Warehouse service providers who convert their
   warehouses into smart modes to serve fast-moving consumer goods
   companies in Tier-2 cities are chosen for the structural framework.
   Results present the role of the `operational efficiency of technology',
   `top management', `employee's education', and `technical background' as
   the most effective driving determinants. This research provides valuable
   information to researchers and managers trying to upgrade their
   warehouse into a smart warehouse.},

	abstract = {Supply chain financing guaranteed by third-party logistics (3PL) firms
   is an effective way to solve the financing difficulties of small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Studies have explored factors that
   affect the willingness of supply chain financial credit providers under
   guarantee of 3PL firms (e.g., the scale of financing enterprises and
   credit). However, whether the scale of 3PL firms will affect the bank's
   credit decision has not been studied, as well as the neural processing
   of credit decisions. To clarify these issues, this study extracted
   behavioral and event-related potentials (ERPs) data when participants
   performed a selection task of judging whether to grant credit to
   guaranteed financing-seeking enterprises according to the large or small
   scale of the 3PL guaranteeing firms. The behavioral results showed that
   under the condition of a large-scale 3PL guaranteeing firm, the
   willingness to provide credit to SMEs was higher than that under the
   condition of a small-scale 3PL guaranteeing firm. This finding indicates
   there was credit scale discrimination against 3PL guaranteeing firms in
   supply chain finance. The ERP results showed that compared with the
   condition of a large-scale 3PL guaranteeing firm, a greater N2 amplitude
   was induced under the condition of a small-scale 3PL guaranteeing firm,
   which indicated that credit decision makers experienced greater
   perceived risk and more decision-making conflict. In contrast, a larger
   LPP amplitude was detected under the condition of a large-scale 3PL
   guaranteeing firm (as opposed to a small-scale firm), which indicated
   that large-scale 3PL guaranteeing firms received more positive comments
   and more positive emotions from credit decision makers than small-scale
   3PL guaranteeing firms. Based on these results, this study reveals the
   cognition process of credit decision makers regarding the impact of the
   3PL guaranteeing firm scale on the willingness to provide credit in
   supply chain finance and explains the theory of credit scale
   discrimination from the perspective of decision neuroscience.},

	abstract = {As digital platforms are dominating the digital economy, complex
   ecologies of platforms are emerging. While the openness of digital
   platforms is an important theme in platform studies, the openness
   between platforms has hardly been studied. This paper explores factors
   that affect decisions by platform owners to open their platforms to
   other platforms. The focus is on Internet-of-Things platforms for
   automotive and healthcare applications. According to the findings,
   platform owners make trade-offs on whether to open up on a case-by-case
   basis. We identify a complex array of factors relating to direct
   benefits and costs (e.g., revenues from selling platform data), indirect
   benefits (e.g., attractiveness of the focal platform to users) as well
   as strategic consideration (e.g., improving bargaining power towards
   other actors). How businesses make trade-offs on these factors depends
   on market-level context (e.g., maturity of the market and standards) and
   organizational context (e.g., strategic focus and business objectives).
   Our findings provide a basis for future studies on the openness between
   platforms, which will become increasingly important as platforms
   proliferate in every layer of the digital industry.},

   networks (IBNs) in various forms (e.g., strategic alliances, franchise

   how IBNs may mitigate uncertainty (emanating especially from disruptive
   digital innovations and global pandemics) through value, configuration
   and/or knowledge-driven governance, strategy, and management. In
   addition, we provide an overview of the articles included in the special

   proposed that used an integrated technology acceptance model (TAM)-TOE
   model and was tested using survey-based data collected from 340
   employees of small, medium and large organizations. The results
   highlight that all the relationships, except organizational readiness,
   organizational compatibility and partner support on perceived ease of

	abstract = {Analyzing multi-vendor mechanical system designs requires a significant
   amount of manual work, resulting in a design paradigm where analysis is
   conducted only after the design is locked and components are selected.
   This leads to a suboptimal design with compatibility issues,
   over-dimensioned components, inferior performance, poor energy
   efficiency, and a lack of collaboration between OEMs (original equipment
   manufacturers) and system integrators. To overcome these issues, this
   paper proposes Co-Des (collaborative design) framework for automated and
   collaborative multi-vendor system design. The framework relies on
   standardized digital twin documents (DTD) of system designs, components,
   and analyses. The discoverability and distribution of these DTDs are
   enabled with digital twin web (DTW). Co-Des framework allows for finding
   suitable components for the design task by automatically running
   selected analyses employing component digital twins. In addition, OEMs
   can provide customized components for system integrators using the
   initial system design defined in the system design DTD. The use of the
   Co-Des framework was demonstrated with a windmill powertrain design use
   case, and the applicability of the automated assembly analysis for
   component selection was verified with performance measurements. The
   adoption of the proposed framework will lead to a paradigm shift from
   manual and siloed work relying on the exchange of PDFs to a more
   automated and collaborative design of mechanical systems. The adoption
   rate is defined by the willingness of system integrators to publish
   their initial system designs and OEMs their components as public digital
   twins.},

	abstract = {Resource optimization is a key concern for Higher Education Institutions
   (HEIs). Cloud Computing, as the recent generation in computing
   technology of the fourth industrial revolution, has emerged as the main
   standard of service and resource delivery. As cloud computing has grown
   into a mature technology and is being rapidly adopted in many HEIs
   across the world, retaining customers of this innovative technology has
   become a challenge to the cloud service providers. Current research
   trends on cloud computing have sought to study the acceptance or
   adoption of technology; however, little research has been devoted to the
   continuance use in an organizational setting. To address this gap, this
   study aims to investigate the antecedents of cloud computing continuance
   use in HEIs. Hence, drawing on the prior literature in
   organizational-level continuance, this research established a conceptual
   model that extends and contextualizes the IS continuance model through
   the lens of the TOE framework (i.e., technological, organizational, and
   environmental influences). The results of a pilot study, conducted
   through a survey with information and communications technology (ICT)
   decision makers, and based on the proposed conceptual model, indicate
   that the instrument is both reliable and valid, and so point the way
   towards further research. The paper closes with a discussion of the
   research limitations, contribution, and future directions.},

	abstract = {To develop entrepreneurial orientation (EO), small and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs) need to possess managerial and organizational
   capabilities. In this paper, we posit that adaptive capabilities (AC)
   and network capabilities (NCs) are assets that allow an SME to
   distinguish itself and establish an entrepreneurial culture. We
   investigate the direct effect of AC on EO. Furthermore, we consider the
   mediating effect of NCs on the AC-EO relationship. The results show that
   a high level of AC fosters EO. In addition, NCs are shown to be
   influenced mainly by the SME's ability to cope with change and build
   relationships with external partners to detect entrepreneurial

	abstract = {Industrial manufacturers are innovating their business models by
   shifting from selling products to selling outcome-based services, where
   the provider (manufacturer) guarantees to deliver the performance
   outcomes of the products and services. This form of business model
   innovation requires a profound yet little understood shift in how value
   is created, delivered, and captured. To address this research gap, our
   study examines two successful and four unsuccessful cases of this shift.
   We find that effectiveness in business model innovation hinges on the
   three process phases that unfold in collaboration with the customers:
   value proposition definition, value provision design, and value-in-use
   delivery. We also find that that success is determined by the alignment
   of specific value creation and value capture activities in each phase:
   identifying value creation opportunities-agreeing on value distribution
   in value proposition definition, designing the value offering-deciding
   on the profit formula in the value provision design, and finally
   refining value creation processes-regulating incentive structures in the
   value-in-use delivery. Our process model contributes to the literature
   and practice on business model innovation by providing a thorough
   understanding of how alignment of value creation and value capture
   processes is ensured, whilst paying special attention to their
   interdependence and the interactions between provider and customer.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 is expected to impart profound changes to the configuration
   of manufacturing companies with regards to what their value proposition
   will be and how their production network, supplier base and customer
   interfaces will develop. The literature on the topic is still
   fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a
   contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study
   assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary
   trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based
   scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The
   results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial
   issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry,
   vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of
   activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of
   possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which
   stem from the experts' comments: demand characteristics, transparency of
   data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing
   and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers
   can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for
   future research on Industry 4.0. Managers and policymakers can leverage
   the scenarios in long-term strategic planning.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm allows the interconnection of
   millions of sensor devices gathering information and forwarding to the
   Cloud, where data is stored and processed to infer knowledge and perform
   analysis and predictions. Cloud service providers charge users based on
   the computing and storage resources used in the Cloud. In this regard,
   Edge Computing can be used to reduce these costs. In Edge Computing
   scenarios, data is pre-processed and filtered in network edge before
   being sent to the Cloud, resulting in shorter response times and
   providing a certain service level even if the link between IoT devices
   and Cloud is interrupted. Moreover, there is a growing trend to share
   physical network resources and costs through Network Function
   Virtualization (NFV) architectures. In this sense, and related to NFV,
   Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) are used to reconfigure the network
   dynamically according to the necessities during time. For this purpose,
   Machine Learning mechanisms, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning
   techniques, can be employed to manage virtual data flows in networks. In
   this work, we propose the evolution of an existing Edge-IoT architecture
   to a new improved version in which SDN/NFV are used over the Edge-IoT
   capabilities. The proposed new architecture contemplates the use of Deep
   Reinforcement Learning techniques for the implementation of the SDN
   controller.},

	abstract = {Human participation in technological research projects has become more
   frequent in recent years. However, most of the technological researchers
   who organize such experimentation are unaware about the various ethical
   and legal implications involved. Further, when it is a medical device
   prototype that is being evaluated, the ethical and legal implications
   may be even more complex. A review of the laws, standards and
   recommendations in Europe has been drawn up regarding human
   participation in new technology co-design, development and evaluation,
   focusing on technological research for assistive and medical devices. An
   easy-to-use tool, called Ethool, which acts as a guideline for European
   technological researchers has been designed and developed. In this
   manuscript, the iterative usability evaluation of Ethool is explained as
   well as the improvements made, following participants' feedback. Ethool
   was rated as acceptable and usable by participants obtaining a SUS score
   of 93.0 in its last evaluation. The tool is currently available to be
   used by any interested parties with the aim of gathering additional
   feedback.},

	abstract = {The Limpopo River Basin (LRB), a transboundary river basin extending
   over Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, is highly
   vulnerable to drought. This manuscript analyzes drought conditions in
   the LRB using Earth Observation (EO) datasets and key drought indices
   such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Vegetation
   Condition Index (VCI). The year 2023, marked by the El Ni \& ntilde;o
   phenomenon, exacerbated dry conditions, resulting in prolonged water
   shortages and reduced agricultural output. Approximately 37\% of the
   basin has been experiencing drought since the 2023-2024 cropping season,
   impacting ecosystems and crop yields. The present manuscript presents a
   comprehensive analysis of drought conditions in the LRB and applications
   of the Digital Twin platform for the LRB to support resource allocation
   for agricultural planning. Integrating multiple near real-time datasets,
   the platform enables policymakers to visualize and analyze drought
   conditions, enhancing decision-making for sustainable resource
   management and food security in the basin.},

	abstract = {To accelerate the growth of Industry 4.0 technologies, the
   digitalization of mechanical testing laboratories as one of the main
   data-driven units of materials processing industries is introduced in
   this paper. The digital lab infrastructure consists of highly detailed
   and standard-compliant materials testing knowledge graphs for a wide
   range of mechanical testing processes, as well as some tools that enable
   the efficient ontology development and conversion of heterogeneous
   materials' mechanical testing data to the machine-readable data of
   uniform and standardized structures. As a basis for designing such a
   digital lab, the mechanical testing ontology (MTO) was developed based
   on the ISO 23718 and ISO/IEC 21838-2 standards for the semantic
   representation of the mechanical testing experiments, quantities,
   artifacts, and report data. The trial digitalization of materials
   mechanical testing lab was successfully performed by utilizing the
   developed tools and knowledge graph of processes for converting the
   various experimental test data of heterogeneous structures, languages,
   and formats to standardized Resource Description Framework (RDF) data
   formats. The concepts of data storage and data sharing in data spaces
   were also introduced and SPARQL queries were utilized to evaluate how
   the introduced approach can result in the data retrieval and response to
   the competency questions. The proposed digital materials mechanical
   testing lab approach allows the industries to access lots of trustworthy
   and traceable mechanical testing data of other academic and industrial
   organizations, and subsequently organize various datadriven research for
   their faster and cheaper product development leading to a higher
   performance of products in engineering and ecological aspects.},

   data are used as a key resource for service propositions. By contrasting
   these cases, we identify and analyse four archetypes: data crawler, data
   marketplace, data aggregator, and data disseminator. We define the key
   features of these archetypes and demonstrate how they realise value via
   the platform. These archetypes can guide managers in realising private

	abstract = {Peer -to -Peer (P2P) lending markets have witnessed remarkable growth,
   revolutionizing the way borrowers and lenders interact. Despite the
   increasing popularity of P2P lending, it poses significant challenges
   related to credit risk assessment and default prediction with meaningful
   implications for financial stability. Traditional credit risk models
   have been widely employed in the field of P2P lending; however, they may
   not be capable to capture latent factor information inherent to a loan
   network based on similarity distances. Thus, in this study we propose an
   enhanced two-step modeling approach for Machine Learning (ML) that
   utilizes insights from network analysis and subsequently combines
   derived network centrality metrics with traditional credit risk factors
   to improve the prediction accuracy in the credit default prediction
   process. Through a comparative analysis of three classical ML models
   with varying degrees of complexity, namely Elastic Net (EN), Random
   Forest (RF), and Multi -Layer Perceptron (MLP), we showcase novel
   evidence that the systematic inclusion of network topology features in
   the credit scoring process can significantly improve the prediction
   accuracy of the scoring models. Additional robustness tests via the
   inclusion of randomly shuffled centrality metrics in the analysis, and a
   further comparison of the graph -based models against a pertinent
   state-of-the-art credit scoring model in form of XGBoost, further
   confirm our results. The insights from this study bear valuable
   conclusions for P2P lending platforms to further improve their scoring
   systems with graph -enhanced metrics, thereby reducing default risk and
   facilitating greater access to credit.},

	abstract = {Understanding how we develop research contributions which go beyond
   conversations in the academic field is an enduring challenge. While much
   has been written on the importance of academic-practitioner
   relationships in the research process more is needed on conceptualizing
   how we develop a wider set of contributions. In this paper, we call for
   researchers to be reflective as to how different forms of expertise can
   be drawn on during collaborative relationships to bridge the research
   practice divide. We develop a framework which combines different levels
   of expertise with varying forms of academic-practitioner collaboration
   to widen the impact of our research. Four strategies are proposed by
   which academics may leverage their expertise in collaborative
   relationships with practitioners to develop Research Impact and
   Contributions To Knowledge (RICK). These include: maintaining critical
   distance, promoting deeper engagement, developing prescience, and
   achieving hybrid practices. We discuss implementation approaches for
   each of these RICK strategies and suggest writing genres to help
   increase engagement by practitioners in research contributions.},

@article{WOS:001078299700001,
	abstract = {Background: Speech contains neuromuscular, physiological and cognitive
   components, and so is a potential biomarker of mental disorders.
   Previous studies indicate that speaking rate and pausing are associated
   with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, results are inconclusive
   as many studies are small and underpow-ered and do not include clinical
   samples. These studies have also been unilingual and use speech
   collected in controlled settings. If speech markers are to help
   understand the onset and progress of MDD, we need to uncover markers
   that are robust to language and establish the strength of associations
   in real-world data.Methods: We collected speech data in 585 participants
   with a history of MDD in the United Kingdom, Spain, and Netherlands as
   part of the RADAR-MDD study. Participants recorded their speech via
   smartphones every two weeks for 18 months. Linear mixed models were used
   to estimate the strength of specific markers of depression from a set of
   28 speech features.Results: Increased depressive symptoms were
   associated with speech rate, articulation rate and intensity of speech
   elicited from a scripted task. These features had consistently stronger
   effect sizes than pauses.Limitations: Our findings are derived at the
   cohort level so may have limited impact on identifying intra-individual
   speech changes associated with changes in symptom severity. The analysis
   of features averaged over the entire recording may have underestimated
   the importance of some features.Conclusions: Participants with more
   severe depressive symptoms spoke more slowly and quietly. Our findings
   are from a real-world, multilingual, clinical dataset so represent a
   step-change in the usefulness of speech as a digital phenotype of MDD.},
