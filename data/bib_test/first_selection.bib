	abstract = {The rapid growth of new computing paradigms such as Cloud Computing and
   Big Data has unleashed great opportunities for companies to shift their
   business model towards a fully digital strategy. A major obstacle in
   this matter is the requirement of highly specialized ICT infrastructures
   that are expensive and difficult to manage. It is at this point that the
   IaaS (infrastructure as a service) model offers an efficient and
   cost-affordable solution to supply companies with their required
   computing resources. In the Big Data context, it is often a hard task to
   design an optimal IaaS solution that meets user requirements. In this
   context, we propose a methodology to optimize the definition of IaaS
   cloud models for hosting Big Data platforms, following a threefold
   criterion: cost, reliability, and computing capacity. Specifically, the
   proposed methodology hinges on evolutionary heuristics in order to find
   IaaS configurations in the cloud that optimally balance such objectives.
   We also define measures to quantify the aforementioned metrics over a
   Big Data platform hosted within an IaaS cloud model. The proposed method
   is validated by using real information from three IaaS providers and
   three Big Data platforms. The obtained results provide an insightful
   input for system managers when initially designing cloud infrastructures
   for Big Data applications.},

	abstract = {Significant advancements within the fields of digitalization,
   electrification, and automation have enabled the development, testing,
   and implementation of increasingly advanced autonomous solutions.
   Current examples of industrial automation promise significant economic
   and sustainability-oriented benefits for industrial customers. Yet,
   implemented autonomous solutions have rarely advanced beyond `islands of
   autonomy'. Although enabling initial improvements in the efficiency and
   effectiveness of operations, they have not led to the systemic process
   improvements that fully integrated site-wide solutions can achieve. It
   is becoming increasingly clear that the major challenges in this shift
   extend beyond technology to focus on business transformation and
   ecosystem relationships. Yet, extant research offers few insights into
   these domains. There is a need to develop a business-focused maturity
   framework for autonomous solutions to contribute to a predominantly
   technical discourse and support equipment actors and their wider
   ecosystems in commercializing autonomous solutions. Thus, the purpose of
   this paper is to investigate how industrial equipment manufacturers can
   align the development of technology, business models and ecosystem
   relationships for the advancement of autonomous solutions. We build on
   case studies that include 32 interviews from four industrial equipment
   manufacturers and their extended ecosystems of customers and partners.
   We capture our findings in a three-level maturity framework for
   industrial autonomous solutions. This framework unwraps the attributes
   of each level from the perspectives of technical system development,
   ecosystem configuration, and business model design and is complemented
   by three overarching principles for the successful commercialization of
   autonomous solutions.},

	abstract = {Does exporting intermediate goods induce learning from importers? In
   this paper, we examine to what extent learning from German industries
   can be explained by knowledge spillovers, channeled through the export
   of intermediate goods. Our study is based on a sample of 27 German trade
   partners in 14 manufacturing industries for the period 2004-2016. Using
   data on patent citations and trading in intermediate goods, we find
   support for the widely known ``learning-by-exporting{''} hypothesis. Our
   analyses reveal that citations to German patents are positively related
   to exported intermediate goods weighted by German R\&D expenditure. The
   relationship between these spillovers and learning seems to be
   particularly strong in certain industries. We also show that the level
   of absorptive capacity of the exporting industry-country plays a
   positive role in mediating these spillovers.},

	abstract = {We examine how firms configure alliance portfolios-that is, networks of

	abstract = {Big Data has recently emerged as a new digital paradigm, one that
   companies adopt in order to both transform existing business models and
   nurture their innovation activities. The peculiarities of Big Data
   applications span different fields such as customer need identification,
   risk management and decision-making, data-driven knowledge, product and
   service design, quality management, and opportunity recognition and
   creation. However, while these have resulted in the emergence of a rich
   research domain focusing on the managerial and practical implications
   typically addressed from the user perspective, there is still a lack of
   complete understanding of how companies that provide Big Data solutions
   can create and capture value from them. This paper explores the question
   of how provider companies create and capture value from Big Data,
   drawing on a multiple-case study analysis of provider companies that
   offer solutions and services based on Big Data. The results illustrate a
   theoretical framework on value creation and capture by relying on Big
   Data and identify two main innovation service strategies based on Big
   Data used by provider companies. In addition, this paper provides
   valuable insights as to how the network of involved stakeholders
   influences the design and implementation of the innovation service
   strategy by the provider companies.},

	abstract = {This study examines how customer firms' digital transformation affects
   the performance and value creation of their suppliers in the Chinese
   context. We use text mining to construct digital transformation
   indicators for customer firms based on data from Chinese A -share
   -listed firms from 2011 to 2021. We find that customer firms' digital
   transformation has a positive and significant impact on supplier
   performance, and this effect is robust to various sensitivity tests. We
   also find that customer firms' digital transformation influences
   supplier performance through two mechanisms: demand push and innovation
   spillover. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that the effect
   of customer firms' digital transformation on supplier performance varies
   by different factors, such as geographic distance, customer
   concentration, ownership type, and industry type. This study contributes
   to the literature on supply chain value from a customer -driven
   perspective and provides practical implications for supply chain firms
   to leverage digital transformation to enhance their performance and
   competitive advantage.},

	abstract = {The business process outsourcing industry has got disrupted, first by
   the significant shift in value creation activities from the clients to
   the service providers, and second by pervasive digital penetration,
   resulting in the emergence of Digital Transformational Outsourcing
   (DTO). Service providers now play a more significant role, making their
   capabilities important. In the new context, service providers require a
   uniquely different set of dynamic capabilities to handle end-to-end
   business functions on behalf of their clients while delivering digital
   value propositions.
   We study 26 of the largest global business process outsourcing providers
   to conceptualise and identify six dynamic capabilities of service
   providers salient in the new context, i.e., consultative, orchestration,
   insights, network management, knowledge access, and standardisation.
   Interviews conducted with industry experts provided evidence in support
   of the identified dynamic capabilities. A novel firm capability dataset
   was created using secondary data, and using fuzzy-set Qualitative
   Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), we identify configurations for high and
   low performance and find them to vary by the firm's broad/narrow scope.},

	abstract = {PurposeIn the era of digital transformation, digital innovation has
   emerged as a crucial driver of competitiveness and growth. However,
   limited knowledge exists on how digital innovation diffuses across
   supply chains, particularly in the manufacturer-distributor
   relationship. Drawing upon diffusion of innovation theory and social
   network theory, this study aims to examine how manufacturers' digital
   innovation impacts distributors' digital innovation, focusing on the
   moderating roles of cooperation length and network status of
   manufacturers and distributors.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses
   a sample of 233 manufacturer-distributor pairs from the Chinese
   paper-making industry. Geographically, the survey comprises sample firms
   nationwide, covering most regions and provinces in China.FindingsThe
   authors find that manufacturers' digital innovation positively affects
   distributors' digital innovation. This relationship is strengthened by
   cooperation length and manufacturers' network status but dampened by
   distributors' network status. The findings provide insights into how
   digital innovation diffuses across supply chain partners and highlight
   the importance of social relationships and network positions in this
   digital innovation diffusion process.Originality/valueThis study makes a
   significant contribution to the field of supply chain management by
   offering deep insights into the diffusion of digital innovation across
   supply chain partners. It highlights the significance of social
   relationships and network positions in the process of digital innovation
   diffusion, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between
   manufacturers and distributors in the context of digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Advancements in digital technology necessitate a shift from traditional
   linear buyer-supplier value chains to a network-centric approach
   facilitated by digital platforms. Despite digital platforms being a
   dominant model for transformation, limited research has explored the
   enablers for incumbent pipeline firms to embrace platformization. To
   address this gap, this study reviews existing literature on digital
   transformation, identifying nine enablers for digital platformization:
   changing client behavior, information technology (IT) capabilities
   development, structural efficiencies, disruptive competitive forces,
   scope advantages, economic triggers, disruptive third-party technology,
   creation of autonomous corporate structures, and regulatory compliance.
   Case studies of platformization in diverse industries are analyzed using
   the modified total interpretive structural modeling (m-TISM) approach,
   resulting in a hierarchical model with five levels. This model
   delineates interrelationships among trigger events, external enablers,
   internal organizational enablers, process enablers, and outcome drivers.
   Furthermore, the study highlights that the creation and extraction of
   value from digital platforms are operationalized through e-business
   strategies, contributing insights to e-business literature by discussing
   the implications of these enablers on dimensions such as commerce,
   collaboration, communication, connection, and computing.},

   (DTS) has become a key concern for many pre-digital organizations across
   traditional industries, but how such a strategy can be developed remains
   an open question. We used interpretive in-depth case study research to
   study how a European financial services provider has formulated and
   implemented a DTS. By focusing on the underlying processes and
   strategizing activities, we show that digital strategy making not only
   represents a break with the conventions of upfront strategic information
   systems (IS) planning, but reveals a new extreme of emergent strategy
   making. Specifically, we conclude that a DTS is continuously in the
   making, with no foreseeable end. By building on theory from IS
   strategizing and strategy-as-practice literature, we theorize an
   integrated process/activity model that characterizes DTS formulation and
   implementation in pre-digital organizations. Our model shows that the
   crafting of a DTS is a highly dynamic process involving iterating
   between learning and doing.},

	abstract = {External knowledge is widely acknowledged to be critical for
   organizational innovation. However, we lack understanding of how
   different sources of knowledge-namely knowledge from customers and
   partners-influence innovation. Grounded in the knowledge-based view of
   the firm, we theoretically develop and empirically test a model of
   mechanisms through which two forms of external knowledge acquisition
   i.e., customer cocreation and partner sourcing, foster knowledge
   creation and innovation. We posit that the different forms of external
   knowledge acquisition contribute differentially toward innovation
   outcomes. Finally, we examine the moderating role of knowledge
   dissemination capability on the relationships between external knowledge
   of both forms. We test our proposed model using data gathered from 655
   organizations in two knowledge intensive sectors i.e., financial and
   information technology. Our model explains 65 \% of the variance in
   knowledge creation and highlights that organizations with higher degree
   of knowledge creation are more likely to innovate through new patents.
   We extend prior research on customer co-creation and organizational
   innovation by identifying intervening organizational variables and
   mechanisms that explicate the effects of external knowledge on
   innovation. The results provide important implications for organizations
   regarding the capabilities needed to utilize external knowledge for
   innovation.},

	abstract = {Over recent decades, many platform-native start-ups and firms were
   founded and some are now among the world's most valuable. This study,
   however, focuses on an incumbent firm transitioning from a long
   established product platform ecosystem to an innovation platform
   ecosystem in response to the platform-natives' threats of disruption. We
   specifically investigate the dynamic capabilities needed by the
   incumbent firm in an enterprise software ecosystem in the transition
   phase. Our analysis builds on multi-perspective empirical data covering
   the viewpoints of all the actor types in the ecosystem, i.e., platform
   owner, platform partners, and end-user firms. The results imply the
   necessity of four dynamic capabilities: resource curation, ecosystem
   preservation, resource reconfiguration, and ecosystem diversification.
   With this study, we contribute to the emerging literature on the
   incumbent firms' transition to a new ecosystem organising logic, and
   extend the study of dynamic capabilities specifically for the case of

	abstract = {In the context of comprehensive business systems engineering,
   manufacturers must establish and maintain robust relationships with
   suppliers and customers in order to remain competitive. This paper
   introduces a Neutrosophic BWM-TOPSIS framework for supplier evaluation,
   addressing the uncertainty inherent to multi-attribute decision-making
   (MADM) during digital transformation (DX). By integrating Neutrosophic
   sets, which extend fuzzy logic, this framework effectively deals with
   ambiguous, inconsistent, and incomplete data. Additionally, it
   incorporates the Best-Worst Method (BWM) with the purpose of determining
   the weights for decision-makers and deploys the Technique for Order of
   Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to rank supplier
   alternatives. A case study carried out for the metro rail coach
   manufacturing industry validates the framework's practical application,
   showcasing its ability to enhance decision-making accuracy. Moreover,
   this study compares the performance of the proposed framework to that of
   existing approaches in terms of informativeness and reliability. This
   research significantly contributes to the field of informatics by
   providing a scalable and systematic decision-making methodology, which
   can also be adapted to other MADM contexts in DX.},

	abstract = {The power of platform business models has grown as our economies become
   increasingly digital, but how companies address the challenge of
   platform growth to achieve a critical mass of users remains unclear. In
   this study, we take a business model (BM) perspective to understand how
   mobile payment platform providers go about addressing such a challenge.
   We studied how mobile payment providers engaged in innovation of their
   business models, and thus identified three pertaining aspects:
   rethinking the relationship management with retailers, creating
   partnerships with other actors in the payment ecosystem to complement
   and deliver the proposed value, and integrating and using front-end
   mobile technology. Furthermore, our study suggests that mobile payment
   providers need to adapt their role within the ecosystem to scale the
   platform, and that it will depend on their choice of scope of geographic
   availability. Finally, we suggest that mutual adaptation of BMs of
   platform-associated actors leads to improved diffusion of the platform
   offer, which also hints at the need for researchers to revisit
   innovation diffusion and technology adoption theories by acknowledging
   the importance of the BM of the offer side of technology.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the negative effect of knowledge hiding on
   the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) capability and
   open innovation (inbound and outbound) when partner trustworthiness
   (benevolence, integrity, and ability) is high. Structural equations were
   used to test this three-way interaction with survey data from a sample
   of 229 firms, mainly from highly digitalized sectors. The findings
   indicate that interorganizational knowledge hiding affects only the
   relationship between AI capability and outbound open innovation and that
   partner ability is the only factor that will counteract this negative
   effect. Therefore, coexploitation of AI-based solutions with external
   allies is the sole scenario to encourage knowledge hiding by increasing
   employees' perceptions of the likelihood of AI negatively impacting
   their personal interests at work. Moreover, when trustworthiness is at
   the forefront of the intraorganizational discussion, the findings
   downplay the significance of benevolence and integrity as traits that
   significantly reduce knowledge hiding. In contrast, at the
   interorganizational level, knowledge hiding is lessened only when
   employees perceive that co-exploitation with external partners
   represents an opportunity to learn and capture crucial AI knowledge.},

	abstract = {Purpose This study aims to explore the resource development process
   implemented by a small consulting firm, active in a traditional
   industrial context, pursuing the innovation path to develop solutions
   within the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) domain. Design/methodology/approach This
   study undertakes a single qualitative case study of Sinergia, an Italian
   innovative small consulting firm. The case study is analyzed through
   critical events and adopting the 4 R model, developed within the
   industrial marketing and purchasing (IMP) approach. Findings The
   analysis highlights a transition from knowledge broker to solution
   provider, based on a process of networking, with a relevant strategizing
   effort, and of assembling internal, external and shared resources. Three
   patterns in the evolution of the company's innovation path emerge:
   resource-oriented networking, hybrid resource development and resource
   assembly. Originality/value The empirical study provides novel empirical
   evidence over localized innovation processes in I4.0 by exploring the
   innovation path pursued by a small consulting firm in connection with
   the local business. The study represents a theoretical development in
   terms of the 4 R model as it suggests the need to further conceptualize
   the category of technical resources - including products and facilities
   - in the increasingly complex I4.0 domain and provides insights on the
   changing role of actors in networks underpinned by emerging resource
   structures.},

	abstract = {Incumbent companies across industries such as banking, insurance, and
   enterprise software have begun transforming their existing product
   platform ecosystems into innovation platforms ecosystems to increase
   generativity in their ecosystems. Such ecosystem transformations not
   only entail technological challenges as the underlying platform
   technology changes but also organizational challenges in that ecosystem
   actors such as partners and customers need to become part of the
   transformed ecosystem. To study how incumbent companies can govern
   ecosystem transformations successfully, we interpret ecosystems as
   organizational fields and ecosystem transformations as changes to the
   fields' institutional infrastructure. Based on a multiyear, grounded
   theory study of the transformation of SAP's on- premises ERP system, we
   first identify institutionalization challenges that arise when
   institutional infrastructure is changed during an ecosystem
   transformation. We then show how field- level governance mechanisms
   address these challenges and how the new institutional infrastructure
   gains legitimacy among ecosystem actors, ultimately leading to the
   institutionalization of the transformed ecosystem. These findings
   contribute to the literature on ecosystem transformations and platform
   governance by highlighting the role that institutional forces play in
   ecosystem transformations. Furthermore, we add to the literature on
   institutional theory by providing insights into the dynamics of
   institutional infrastructure as it becomes infused with digital
   technologies.},

	abstract = {Digital collaboration capability, which refers to a company's ability to
   share and coordinate information with partners via digital channels, is
   one of the primary organizational capabilities that helps companies gain
   differentiation advantages. However, there is still no consensus on how
   companies should leverage digital collaboration capability to improve
   their services. To fill this gap, we develop a moderated mediation model
   from the perspective of absorptive capacity. Through the survey of 205
   Chinese information technology (IT) companies, we find that potential
   absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity fully mediate the
   positive relationship between digital collaboration capability and
   service innovation, suggesting that digital collaboration capability can
   improve a company's services only when it is translated into absorptive
   capability. More interestingly, technological turbulence strengthens the
   mediation effect of absorptive capacity, implying that a high-level
   technical environment better facilitates companies to absorb information
   and knowledge from different digital channels and subsequently improves
   service innovation. We contribute to the existing digital innovation
   literature by articulating the moderated mediation mechanisms through
   which digital collaboration capability influences service innovation.
   Our study also provides managerial implications for companies on how to
   boost service innovation in the digital era.},

	abstract = {In today's rapidly evolving business environment, firms are striving to
   enhance their ability to respond swiftly to changing market conditions.
   To address this challenge, the strategic use of collaborative
   information systems has emerged as a key factor, particularly within
   supply chain management. Supply chain partners collaborate through these
   systems to improve decision-making quality, optimize supply chain
   networks, and response uncertainties. Given that most collaborative
   workflows occur in these systems, the effectiveness of a organization's
   response is heavily influenced by the quality of systems. Consequently,
   this study examines the quality factors of collaborative systems and the
   structural relationships to organizational agility and corporate
   performance. In addition, our research is focused on the concept of
   organizational agility within the context of digital transformation and
   the post-COVID era, integrating perspectives from information systems,
   organizational behavior, and strategic management. The study finds that
   information quality is crucial for information collaboration, while
   service quality significantly impacts operational collaboration.
   Emphasizing the importance of comprehensive operational integration, the
   research aligns with recent literature on the role of integrated
   business processes in enhancing organizational agility and performance.
   The findings underscore the necessity for a balanced approach in
   collaborative system development, highlighting the importance of both
   information and service quality in optimizing collaboration and
   improving organizational outcomes in the digital age.},

	abstract = {This study explores relationships among various aspects of Innovation
   Intermediaries' (IIs) business models and their intention to provide
   digital and data-enabled services to their members/customers. Using
   mixed research methods with data collected from Danish IIs, we find that
   IIs' current use level of digital resources has a positive relationship
   with their intention of offering digital and data services, while the
   level of existing digital services demotivates or prevents IIs from
   providing them. We also find that the breadth of IIs' customers and
   partnerships is not directly associated with their intention to offer
   more digital services in the future. These findings are enriched with
   nuanced insights from a follow-up qualitative study showing that
   strategic partners do not provide the required support for
   intermediaries to develop and provide digital offerings. Instead, IIs
   rely on system integrators to equip themselves with the needed digital
   capacity to support their members/customers. The study contributes to
   the understanding of IIs' business models linked to their service
   catalogue, particularly on digital offerings and their function as
   digitalization champions in a shifting paradigm of industrial digital

	abstract = {Purpose - Firms are driven to ride on the digital wave in today's open
   innovation ecosystem. This study aims to explore the effect of digital
   transformation (DT) on knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS)
   firms' innovation ambidexterity, namely, radical versus incremental
   innovation, respectively. Meanwhile, the authors evaluated the
   moderating role of the complexity of R\&D collaboration portfolio (i.e.
   organizational diversity and geographic diversity) in the above
   relationships.Design/methodology/approach - Using a panel data set of
   171 Chinese listed firms in the information and communications
   technology services industry from 2010 to 2018, the proposed hypotheses
   were empirically attested.Findings - It is found that DT has a positive
   relationship with radical innovation and an inverted U-shaped
   relationship with incremental innovation. In terms of the R\&D
   collaboration portfolio, organizational diversity positively moderates
   the relationships between DT and innovation ambidexterity, respectively.
   The geographic diversity weakens the inverted U-shaped effect of DT on
   incremental innovation; however, its moderating role in the link between
   DT and radical innovation is not empirically verified.Originality/value
   - Extant scholars mainly addressed the interplay between KIBS firms and
   their manufacturing clients, while this study reveals the different
   consequences of DT on KIBS firms' innovation ambidexterity to highlight
   the role of KIBS firms is an independent and essential innovator in a
   knowledge-driven economy. Notably, the findings contribute to knowledge
   management (KM) and R\&D literature by confirming the diversity of the
   R\&D collaboration portfolio is a critical KM strategy for KIBS firms to
   develop and promote external knowledge resources.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation is increasingly recognized as a key driver of
   sustainable development, enabling suppliers to improve efficiency,
   reduce resource consumption, and adapt to changing market demands.
   However, it remains a challenging process for suppliers, often hindered
   by resource and capacity constraints. This study investigates how
   government subsidies can facilitate supplier digital transformation,
   considering supply chain diffusion and local government competition
   dynamics. Using data from A-share listed companies in China between 2010
   and 2021, our analysis reveals that government subsidies significantly
   promote supplier digital transformation by encouraging a more
   diversified downstream customer base. Moreover, customer digital
   transformation can facilitate supplier digital transformation, but
   spillover effects are higher within the same jurisdiction than across
   different jurisdictions. This study further identifies that the impact
   of government subsidies is more pronounced under higher opportunistic
   risk but is constrained by systemic risk. Additionally, suppliers with
   higher human capital and a smaller digital divide with customers exhibit
   greater effectiveness in adopting innovation diffusion. These findings
   provide valuable insights into optimizing local government subsidies
   policies to enhance supplier digital transformation and contribute to
   the broader goal of sustainable development.},

   organizations are increasingly turning to Agile project management to
   deliver innovation programs. Deployment of Agile poses specific
   challenges, often because the required skills, measures, and management
   behaviors differ greatly than those of traditional project management.
   When faced with a need to outsource Agile project delivery to a third
   party, organizations often apply contractual approaches developed for
   traditional ``waterfall{''} projects, which prove unsuitable. This study
   investigated the perspective of client-side advisors in Agile projects
   when delivery is outsourced to a third party. Client-side sourcing
   advisors are an important component of the Agile delivery ecosystem
   because clients often rely on advisors' experience when scoping out and

	abstract = {Digital transformation (DX) has driven significant company changes,
   restructuring products, processes, and services by integrating emerging
   technologies across all organisational levels. This change enhances
   workflows, decision-making, and operational efficiency, fostering
   innovation and competitive advantage. This research analyses how
   effective technology implementation, employee engagement, usability
   awareness, and strategic management practices can improve organisational
   processes. By analysing interconnections among DX, human factors,
   business processes, and emerging technologies, the research employs a
   systematic literature review and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to
   identify critical factors for success. The findings highlight that
   digital tools streamline operations and support data-driven decisions,
   reducing cognitive overload through user-centred design. This research
   proposes a Human-Oriented Process Enhancement (H.O.P.E.) model that
   integrates DX with human-centric factors to guide digital technology
   applications and improve organisational performance. The practical
   application of this model was carried out as part of a litigation
   management project in an automotive supplier manufacturing plant
   specialising in advanced solutions across seating, interiors, and clean
   mobility technologies. The project sought to streamline legal processes,
   enhance compliance, and mitigate risks through structured litigation
   management. In conclusion, the digital maturity and human factors (DMHF)
   index, the outcome of the H.O.P.E. model, has proven to be a
   comprehensive tool for aligning DX adoption with organisational
   strategic goals considering human-centric factors. Future research will
   focus on customising the index for industry-specific needs, particularly
   ergonomics, to ensure organisations achieve sustainable growth in a
   digital setting.},

   intermediaries in enabling a successful digital co-creation, yet a
   deeper understanding of this novel and evolving context is required.
   Through a comprehensive study of two innovation intermediaries, five
   incumbent companies, and eleven start-ups, we shed light on how
   intermediaries can effectively mitigate the hard-to-manage tensions that
   emerge. Our analysis uncovers three primary tensions: incompatible
   digital co-creation cultures, divergent digital innovation operations,
   and misaligned technical capabilities. We further propose a four-phase
   process for innovation intermediation, including the establishment of
   digital co-creation foundations, catalysing digital innovation projects,
   orchestrating the co-creation process, and scaling the resulting
   outcomes.},

@article{WOS:000719304200008,
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Innovation based on information and communication technology
   (ICT) plays an increasingly important role in agricultural
   research-for-development efforts. It has been recognized, however, that
   the weak adoption and low impact of many ICT-for-agriculture (ICT4Ag)
   efforts are partly due to poor design. Often, design was driven more by
   technological feasibility than by a thorough analysis of the target
   group's needs and capacities. For more user-centered ICT4Ag development,
   there is now growing interest in the use of systematic, participatory
   design methodologies. OBJECTIVE: Numerous methodologies for
   participatory design exist, but applying any of them in smallholder
   farming context can create specific challenges that digital development
   researchers need to deal with. This article aims to support future
   digital development efforts by contributing practical insights to recent
   discussions on the use of participatory design methodologies for ICT4Ag
   development. METHODS: We present lessons learned from practical
   experiences within participatory design projects that developed ICT4Ag
   solutions in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Based on these
   experiences and supported by literature, we describe common challenges
   and limitations that digital designers may face in practice, and discuss
   possible opportunities for dealing with them. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:
   The outcomes of digital design projects within research-for-development
   efforts can be affected by tensions between design ideals and project
   realities. These tensions may relate to, among others, mismatching
   expectations among project stakeholders, top-down hierarchies at design
   partners, insuf- ficient attention to the wider digital ecosystem, and
   disincentives to re-use ideas and software. Depending on project
   context, these challenges may need to be addressed by researchers during
   planning and implementation of digital design projects. SIGNIFICANCE:
   The insights in this article may support agricultural development
   researchers in facilitating more effective participatory design
   processes. Even though good design is not the only precondition for a
   successful ICT4Ag service, this can help create more meaningful digital
   innovation for agricultural development.},

	abstract = {Digital technologies are radically changing how established
   organizations design novel services. Digital transformation (DT)
   strategies are executed to manage the transition from product-centric to
   service-centric business models based on digital technologies. However,
   little is known about what configurations of DT strategies lead to
   successful digital service innovation (DSI) in established
   organizations. We employ fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis on a
   set of 17 case studies of DT strategies from established organizations
   with different industry backgrounds. We identify several distinct
   configurations of DT strategies that lead to successful and unsuccessful
   DSI. Based on these configurations, we deduce that the threat of digital
   disruption negatively impacts an organization's innovation activities.
   Furthermore, we find that strategic partnerships can be leveraged by
   organizations that face an imminent threat of digital disruption while
   organizations with competitive advantages may rely on
   ``do-it-yourself{''} approaches. Lastly, we find that the involvement of
   a C-level executive is a necessary requirement for successful DSI. Our
   results contribute to theory by integrating research on DSI and DT,
   providing a perspective on DSI failure, and employing a configurational
   research approach that allows us to highlight interdependencies between
   factors as well as insights into the individual factors. Furthermore, we
   provide actionable recommendations for executives.},

	abstract = {The digital transformation of the public sector is a crucial objective
   for the European Commission and member states. Concerns arise due to US
   and Chinese tech giants' dominance in cloud computing, impacting
   sovereignty, privacy, and security. Some European member states
   established restrictions on non-EU Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to
   ensure compliance with European data protection laws. Investigating how
   states respond to growingly infrastructuralized non-EU public CSPs is
   crucial. This paper scrutinizes the Italian Cloud Strategy in the
   context of the public sector's migration to the cloud. Critical and
   interpretive policy analysis tools are employed to examine the
   Strategy's underlying problematizations and prevailing discourses. The
   paper argues that while the Italian Strategy recognizes the trade-off
   between pragmatism and sovereignty, it lacks comprehensive solutions.
   The unquestioned dominance of non-EU public CSPs, symbolic proposals,
   and limitations in data classification call for further considerations
   to strike a balance between pragmatism and safeguarding digital
   sovereignty.},

	abstract = {Supplier selection (SS) has emerged as a critical challenge for
   companies aiming to enhance the operational management of their supply
   chains, a task that has grown in complexity with the advent of Industry
   4.0 and the ongoing digital transformation. Recognizing the gaps in
   current literature-specifically, the lack of consideration for
   stakeholders' expectations in guiding SS, as well as the inadequate
   handling of epistemic and stochastic uncertainties-this paper introduces
   a multiple-criteria Quality Function Deployment (QFD)-based model for
   SS. To address epistemic uncertainty, we put forward a novel subjective
   judgment representation method, which is named as linguistic term set
   integrated with discrete subjective probability distribution (LTS-DSPD),
   to enable decision-makers to express their judgments in a manner that is
   both simpler and more nuanced. Furthermore, we also give the elicitation
   methods and computing techniques for LTS-DSPD. Then, we integrate
   stakeholders' requirements, along with their preferences and
   expectations for these requirements to inform and guide SS. To
   effectively operationalize this guidance, we design the QFD-based
   methods to transform stakeholders' inputs into the assessment criteria
   for SS, the weights of criteria, and the expectations for the
   performances of suppliers on each criterion, respectively. To address
   stochastic uncertainty, we have developed an innovative methodology for
   characterizing it, and adopt prospect theory to quantify the overall
   utility of alternative suppliers. The paper concludes with a case study
   to demonstrate its practical application and effectiveness in
   streamlining SS process.},

	abstract = {Purpose The study aims to investigate whether and how digital
   transformation, in terms of digital collaboration, joint efforts with
   internal/external partners to achieve common goals and the adoption of
   digital tools supporting this practice, affect social innovation capital
   in the context of small innovative enterprises (SIEs).
   Design/methodology/approach The research hypotheses derived from the
   analysis of the literature, evaluating how sharing resources, sharing
   intensity and digital patterns affect the collective capacity of SIEs to
   innovate, were investigated by applying multiple regression analysis.
   Data were retrieved from a sample of Italian SIEs through an online
   survey. Findings The main findings suggest that the propensity to spread
   resources and the sharing intensity positively affect the collective
   capacity of SIEs to innovate. Also, the effect of resources sharing on
   collective innovation increases as more digital patterns are used as
   tools. The connection is weaker for the intensity of resources sharing.
   Research limitations/implications The study is conducted on Italian
   SIEs, a particular cluster of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It
   would be interesting to compare and contrast the results of an analysis
   of a large sample of international companies, of different sizes and
   belonging to digital and non-digital sectors. Originality/value The
   results enrich the existing literature on social innovation capital, by
   clarifying its competitive benefits on the characteristic context of the
   SIEs and underlining the mediating role of the digital patterns.},

   Design/methodology/approach This paper builds on an explorative case
   study of a manufacturing firm and its IoT suppliers. This paper relies
   on the Industrial Network Approach to study interfaces between buying
   firms and their suppliers. Findings This paper identifies three distinct
   types of supplier interfaces: connected, digital and digital-physical.
   They all contain technical resource interfaces with additional
   organizational and/or technical complexities that need to be managed.
   Connectivity, an Agile approach to software development and strong
   technical dependence emerged as key factors that impact the interactions
   between manufacturing firms and IoT suppliers and how their resources
   are combined. Practical implications This paper offers managerial
   implications regarding the importance of internal organization (such as
   appropriate cross-functional teams) to manage the dynamics of
   collaborations required by digital technologies, maintain interactions
   with IoT suppliers and identify and manage interdependences between IoT
   suppliers. Building close relationships with suppliers of crucial
   infrastructure (e.g. IoT cloud platform and data security systems) can
   also be beneficial for manufacturing firms to reduce risks. Finally,
   attention should be given to IoT technology strategy, which impacts both
   digital and digital-physical supplier interfaces. Originality/value In
   digital servitization, manufacturing firms are heavily reliant on
   external resources for IoT technology. Despite this, few studies have
   investigated the characteristics of their interfaces with IoT suppliers,

	abstract = {In times of disruption, a company's ability to manage its supply chain
   effectively can determine its success or failure. This paper explores
   the extent to which strategic partnership development, mediated by
   digital transformation, enhances supply chain effectiveness during such
   periods. A mixed methods approach was used, involving surveys and
   interviews with professionals from the Saudi Arabian manufacturing
   sector. The study's findings reveal that digital transformation and
   strategic partnerships work synergistically together to enhance supply
   chain resilience and effectiveness, resulting in improved operational
   agility and adaptability. Four key enablers of supply chain digital
   transformation were identified: inter-business coordination, leadership,
   technological culture, and recruitment management. These insights
   contribute significantly to our understanding of how businesses can
   build resilient supply chains in uncertain environments.},

   interconnected shifts: (1) from planning to discovery, (2) from scarcity
   to abundance, and (3) from hierarchy to partnership. Organizational
   identity, dematerialization, and collaboration play a key role in this
   transformation. For managers, the study identifies a comprehensive set

	abstract = {Digitalization is viewed as a source of future competitiveness due to
   its potential for unlocking new valuecreation and revenue-generation
   opportunities. To profit from digitalization, providers and customers
   tend to move away from transactional product-centric model to relational
   service-oriented engagement. This relational transformation is brought
   about through digital servitization. However, current knowledge about
   how providers and customers transform their relationship to achieve
   benefits from digital servitization is lacking. This paper addresses
   that knowledge gap by applying the relational view theory to a study of
   four provider-customer relationships engaged in digital servitization.
   The results provide evidence for four relational components -
   complementary digitalization capabilities, relation-specific digital
   assets, digitally enabled knowledge-sharing routines, and partnership
   governance - that enable providers and customers to profit from digital
   servitization. A key contribution is the development of a relational
   transformation framework for digital servitization that provides an
   overview of how the four relational components evolve as the
   relationship progresses. In doing so, we contribute to the emerging
   servitization literature by offering key relational insights into the
   interdependence of activities throughout the transformation phases of
   provider-customer relationships in digital servitization.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how digital
   transformation changes highly traditional business processes and how it
   impacts value co-creation and co-destruction. More specifically, the aim
   is to examine, using the resource interaction approach, how the friction
   between non-digital and digital resources affects the co-creation and
   co-destruction of value in a network during digital transformation.
   Based on this, the authors provide managerial implications on how to
   handle simultaneous digital and traditional business processes to
   co-create value during digital transformation.
   Design/methodology/approach A case study is conducted of a digital
   platform provider and of three traditional confectioneries. In this
   analysis, the authors looked at the business processes of highly
   traditional confectioneries that have introduced online services through
   a digital platform and are undergoing digital transformation. Findings
   In some industries, it is neither possible nor advisable to fully
   digitalise all business processes, and companies have to partially
   retain their traditional, analogue character to create value. The
   process of value co-creation during digital transformation is affected
   by friction between the digital and non-digital resources and is
   mitigated by specific lubricants (e.g. mutual reliance, smooth personal
   communication, willingness to help, attitude towards change). This
   results in the improvement of processes and capabilities in terms of
   digital development and traditional production. Friction may also lead
   to value co-destruction, for example, as the result of transformation
   from face-to-face to digital interactions. Originality/value The authors
   contribute to research on the digital transformation of highly
   traditional companies that need to introduce new, digital technologies
   and resources while continuing their traditional processes. The authors
   develop the concept of lubricants that mitigate the friction between
   resources and, therefore, facilitate value co-creation in a business
   network. Additionally, the authors provide managerial implications for
   how to handle simultaneous digital and traditional business processes
   during digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Industrial manufacturers are innovating their business models by
   shifting from selling products to selling outcome-based services, where
   the provider (manufacturer) guarantees to deliver the performance
   outcomes of the products and services. This form of business model
   innovation requires a profound yet little understood shift in how value
   is created, delivered, and captured. To address this research gap, our
   study examines two successful and four unsuccessful cases of this shift.
   We find that effectiveness in business model innovation hinges on the
   three process phases that unfold in collaboration with the customers:
   value proposition definition, value provision design, and value-in-use
   delivery. We also find that that success is determined by the alignment
   of specific value creation and value capture activities in each phase:
   identifying value creation opportunities-agreeing on value distribution
   in value proposition definition, designing the value offering-deciding
   on the profit formula in the value provision design, and finally
   refining value creation processes-regulating incentive structures in the
   value-in-use delivery. Our process model contributes to the literature
   and practice on business model innovation by providing a thorough
   understanding of how alignment of value creation and value capture
   processes is ensured, whilst paying special attention to their
   interdependence and the interactions between provider and customer.},

@article{WOS:000652475700001,
	abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to explore the perceptions of supply chain
   managers regarding the elements that make up cyber supply chain risk
   management (CSCRM) and the related level of alignment, to understand how
   organizations can deploy a CSCRM strategy that goes beyond the
   technical, internal functioning of single companies and moves beyond the
   dyad, to create a better alignment that can ultimately lead to improved
   cyber supply chain resilience.
   Design/methodology/approach
   An exploratory survey in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry
   involving over 100 organizations in Italy was conducted. Results were
   analysed through one-way analysis of variance, to appraise the
   differences in the perceptions of the various actors of the FMCG supply
   chain (Manufacturers, Logistics Service Providers, Retailers).
   Findings
   While a certain degree of alignment of the perceptions across the FMCG
   supply chain exists, the study found that Logistics Service Providers
   can play a crucial role as orchestrators of the CSCRM process towards a
   more ``supply chain-oriented{''} response to cyber threats and risk
   events. The research also highlights the necessity to see people as key
   elements for improving cyber resilience in the supply chain.
   Research limitations/implications
   Through a vertical analysis of a supply chain, the study extends the
   existing theory on CSCRM, which contains isolated case studies. It also
   contributes to extending the current theory with the proposal of the
   paradigm of Logistics Service Providers as orchestrators of the CSCRM
   process. The study combines different classifications of CSCRM
   initiatives and embraces theories external to the supply chain
   literature.
   Practical implications
   Through the empirical analysis, this study helps practitioners in
   streamlining the design of cyber security strategies and actions that
   span across the supply chain for better alignment. This could mean more
   coordination of efforts and more targeted/accurate investments in CSCRM
   initiatives. The study invites practitioners to ponder the perceived
   relevance of the human factor as a source of risk and the perceived
   importance of countermeasures aimed at mitigating risk events stemming
   from that source.
   Originality/value
   By focusing on an entire supply chain, this is one of the first studies
   on CSCRM that goes beyond the dyad. Its originality also lies in its use
   of the investigations of perceptions along the supply chain as pillars
   for the alignment of CSCRM strategies and mitigation initiatives. This
   original perspective allows for discovering the role of Logistics
   Service Providers in driving the alignment of the efforts towards better
   outcomes of the CSCRM process.},
