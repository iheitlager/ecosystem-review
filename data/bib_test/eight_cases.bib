   abstract = {Advancements in digital technology necessitate a shift from traditional linear buyer-supplier value chains to a network-centric approach facilitated by digital platforms. Despite digital platforms being a dominant model for transformation, limited research has explored the enablers for incumbent pipeline firms to embrace platformization. To address this gap, this study reviews existing literature on digital transformation, identifying nine enablers for digital platformization: changing client behavior, information technology (IT) capabilities development, structural efficiencies, disruptive competitive forces, scope advantages, economic triggers, disruptive third-party technology, creation of autonomous corporate structures, and regulatory compliance. Case studies of platformization in diverse industries are analyzed using the modified total interpretive structural modeling (m-TISM) approach, resulting in a hierarchical model with five levels. This model delineates interrelationships among trigger events, external enablers, internal organizational enablers, process enablers, and outcome drivers. Furthermore, the study highlights that the creation and extraction of value from digital platforms are operationalized through e-business strategies, contributing insights to e-business literature by discussing the implications of these enablers on dimensions such as commerce, collaboration, communication, connection, and computing.},

@article{Piccoli2024,
   abstract = {Responding to recent calls, this essay offers a commentary on the framing and definition of organizational digital transformation. We focus on the unique ontology of digital transformation and delineate it from neighboring concepts. Our contention is that, despite its volume, current research remains unclear about how the digital transformation of organizations differs from their IT-enabled transformation. We advocate definitional precision to foster knowledge accumulation and to enable scholars to pursue important research questions that are unique to digital transformation. Our perspective, grounded in the notion of digital resources, defines digital transformation as the metamorphosis of an IT-enabled organization into a digital organization – one with a specific digital architecture and design principles. A key departure from previous conceptualization is that we characterize digital transformation as a change in digital technology architecture rather than a change from digital technology use. Our paper achieves the following: describes the constructs underpinning this formulation, digital resources and digital organization; justifies their use; and describes what research directions the new perspective promotes. With sound definitions of key constructs, Information Systems scholars have the unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in digital “x” research, making our discipline the reference point for the burgeoning “digital research” literature in related business fields.},

   abstract = {The literature argues that a real digital transformation of firms requires holistic changes of the business model. Despite knowledge about this ambitious goal, understanding of how digital business model transformation can be achieved is still very limited. In this article, we explore how firms achieve digital business model transformation. We apply a case study design to investigate how incumbents have changed their respective business model dimensions during digital transformation. Our findings center on interview data and complementary archival records from 15 cases. We present a framework for digital business model transformation along the dimensions of value proposition, value creation, and value capture. Our results emphasize the importance of a preparatory phase in which the strategic course is set. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that transforming a company's business model is most effective when a single person, namely the Chief Digital Officer, is responsible. Our findings contribute to the business model literature, by providing a more holistic view on how business model innovation can be utilized during digital transformation.},

@article{Volpentesta2023,
   abstract = {Purpose: Digital transformation (DT) is a major challenge for incumbent organisations, as research on this phenomenon has revealed a high failure rate. Given this consideration, this paper reviews the literature on DT in incumbent organisations to identify the main themes and research directions to be undertaken. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt a systematic literature review (SLR) and computational literature review (CLR) employing a machine learning algorithm for topic modelling (LDA) to surface the themes discussed in 103 peer-reviewed studies published between 2010 and 2022 in a multidisciplinary article sample. Findings: The authors identify and discuss the five main themes emerging from the studies, offering the state-of-the-art of DT in established firms' literature. The authors find that the most discussed topics revolve around the DT of healthcare, the process of renewal and change, the project management, the changes in value performances and capabilities and the consequences on the products of DT. Accordingly, the authors identify the topics overlooked by literature that future studies could tackle, which concern sustainability and contextualisation of the DT phenomenon. Practical implications: The authors further propose managerial insights which equip managers with a revolutionary mindset that is not constraining but, rather, integration-seeking. DT is not only about technology (Tabrizi B et al., 2019). Successful DT initiatives require managerial capabilities that foster a sustainable departure from the current organising logic (Markus, 2004). This study pinpoints and prioritises the role that paradox-informed thinking can have to sustain an effective digital mindset (Eden et al., 2018) that allows for the building of momentum in DT initiatives and facilitates the renewal process. Indeed, managers lagging behind DT could shift from an “either-or” solutions mindset where one pole is preferred over the other (e.g. digital or physical) to embracing a “both-and-with” thinking balancing between poles (e.g. digital and physical) to successfully fuse the digital and the legacy (Lewis and Smith, 2022b; Smith, Lewis and Edmondson, 2022), enact the renewal, and build and maintain momentum for DTs. The outcomes of adopting a paradox mindset in managerial practice are enabling learning and creativity, fostering flexibility and resilience and, finally, unleashing human potential (Lewis and Smith, 2014). Social implications: The authors propose insight that will equip managers with a mindset that will allow DT to fail less often than current reported rates, which failure may imply potential organisational collapse, financial bankrupt and social crisis. Originality/value: The authors offer a multidisciplinary review of the DT complementing existing reviews due to the focus on the organisational context of established organisations. Moreover, the authors advance paradoxical thinking as a novel lens through which to study DT in incumbent organisations by proposing an array of potential research questions and new avenues for research. Finally, the authors offer insights for managers to help them thrive in DT by adopting a paradoxical mindset.},

Our research underscores the critical role of innovation intermediaries in enabling a successful digital co-creation, yet a deeper understanding of this novel and evolving context is required. Through a comprehensive study of two innovation intermediaries, five incumbent companies, and eleven start-ups, we shed light on how intermediaries can effectively mitigate the hard-to-manage tensions that emerge. Our analysis uncovers three primary tensions: incompatible digital co-creation cultures, divergent digital innovation operations, and misaligned technical capabilities. We further propose a four-phase process for innovation intermediation, including the establishment of digital co-creation foundations, catalysing digital innovation projects, orchestrating the co-creation process, and scaling the resulting outcomes.},

Despite its relevance, incumbent companies still face challenges in implementation due to the complex character of transformation processes. We provide a framework serving as guidance for leaders of digital transformations. Based on an explorative research design, we conducted 33 semi-structured interviews with experts of digital transformations of incumbent companies. Our findings indicate that leaders need to understand the terminologies related to exploration, exploitation, and digital transformation, and the complex interaction between all three areas. This includes digital literacy and being aware of differentiated treatment of exploration and exploitation in innovations and the relevance of both. Leaders must acknowledge that industry and organizational characteristics influence organizations’ tendencies towards exploration or exploitation in innovations. Exploration in digital transformation is about using digital technologies to rethink business models. Using digital technologies to optimize existing processes, products, and IT infrastructure is associated with exploitation. In sum, we need different target settings and approaches for the required activities.},
